The referral indicated that Community Water System, Inc. (CWS), an Arkansas non-profit domestic corporation, through the activities of former CWS General Manager Greg Smith, might have reimbursed political contributions made by outside vendors of CWS to the campaigns of Senator Tim Hutchinson and Representative Marion Berry. Three respondents, Heartsill Ragon, Charles Owen and Chris Travis, each confirmed in interviews that they made contributions to either or both Marion Berry and Tim Hutchinson for Senate in August 2002, but each denied participating in a reimbursement scheme. CWS denied it violated any laws and should not be held responsible for any alleged unlawful conduct of its former general manager, Greg Smith. They further stated that upon learning of the allegations, members of the Board of Directors of CWS made several attempts in the fall of 2002 to bring allegations against Mr. Smith to the attention of various authorities with no success. Mr. Smith&#8217;s response stated that the source of this complaint was attempting to use the Federal Election Commission to promote and advance private interests, and obtain a favorable posture in civil litigation pending in the Circuit Court for Cleburne County, State of Arkansas. Furthermore he maintained that he knew and understood the law regarding election campaign donations and that neither he nor Community Water Services violated any of those provisions. The Commission decided to take no further action against the respondents and close the file. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5514under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p>&#160;</p>\n          </td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>2.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5555&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>MUR 5555</strong></a><strong> </strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Dave Ross</p>\n            <p>(b)&#160;&#160; Friends of Dave Ross, Philip Lloyd, treasurer</p>\n            (c)&#160;&#160; Entercom Seattle, LLC (d/b/a KIRO-AM) </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p> Chris Vance  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p> In-kind corporate contribution; media exemption  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>DISPOSITION:</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a-c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; No reason to believe</p>\n            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (re: any provision of the Act)</p>\n            <p/>\n          The complainant alleged that Dave Ross received free air time on his own show to promote his candidacy, and that the radio station illegally contributed to his campaign by providing him with that air time and continuing to promote the Show throughout the 2004 campaign season. The collective response by Friends of Dave Ross and Dave Ross stated that the activities mentioned in the complaint were legitimate press activities and are entitled to the media exemption. Furthermore they stated that if the Commission found that these activities did not qualify for the media exemption, any communications made by Dave Ross could not be considered expenditures or electioneering communications because they were not for the purpose of influencing a federal election. Entercom responded that it took extraordinary steps to ensure that it did not undertake any activities that could, in any way, support electioneering activities by Dave Ross except for the airing of his announcement of his impending candidacy as well as a legitimate news interview of Dave Ross, both legitimate news events. The Commission found no reason to believe that the respondents violated the Act and closed the case. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering  5653 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>      \n      <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      <p align=\"center\"><strong><em><u>Dismissed &#8211; Low Rated</u></em></strong></p>      \n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>3.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5633&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5633</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Cannon for Congress, Curtis S.
