Bush or the defeat of Senator John Kerry, constituting expenditures under the Act.&#160;&#160; </p>\n      <p align=\"left\">If an organization receives contributions or makes expenditures in excess of $1,000, and its major purpose is involvement in campaign activity, it must register with the Commission as a Federal political committee and abide by the contribution restrictions and reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA/the Act).&#160; PFA-VF registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a &#8220;Section 527&#8221; organization &#8211; a tax exempt group whose function is to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to Federal, State, or local public office or office in a political organization.&#160; As PFA-VF itself said, it was formed to &#8220;focus primarily on TV and radio in key battleground states serving as [a] counter-balance to liberal 527 committees.&#8221;</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">Through its public statements, activities, and solicitations for contributions, PFA-VF clearly established that it was a Federal political committee during the 2004 campaign.&#160; The FEC&#8217;s determination that PFA-VF failed to register with the Commission as a political committee, abide by contribution limits and prohibitions, and file disclosure reports resulted in an agreement to:</p>\n      <div align=\"left\">\n        <ul>\n          <li>pay a $750,000 civil penalty; </li>\n            <li>cease and desist from further violating the law and regulations; and </li>\n            <li>file reports with the Commission for the relevant periods containing all of the information that must be disclosed by Federal political committees.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>      <p align=\"left\"/>\n      <p align=\"left\">Case Summary:</p>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5487&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5487</a></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Progress for America Voter Fund (PFA-VF)</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a) Democracy 21</p>\n              <p>(b) Campaign Legal Center </p>\n              <p>(c) Center for Responsive Politics</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Failure to register as a political committee; failure to report contributions and expenditures; knowingly accepting excessive contributions from individuals; knowingly accepting corporate contributions</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DISPOSITION:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Conciliation Agreement: $750,000 civil penalty*</p>\n              <p>The complaint alleged that the PFA-VF violated various provisions of the Act by failing to register with the Federal Election Commission as a political committee.&#160; The complaint further alleged that PFA-VF failed to file necessary disclosure reports and comply with FECA&#8217;s contribution limits and source prohibitions.&#160; The Commission found reason to believe that PFA-VF was a political committee and had violated the registration and reporting requirements and contribution limits and prohibitions of the Act. </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the</p>\n              <p>Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering</p>\n              <p>5487 under case numbers in the Enforcement Query System.
