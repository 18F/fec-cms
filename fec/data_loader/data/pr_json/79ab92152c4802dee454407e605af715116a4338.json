While the search field remains in the upper right corner of the FEC&#8217;s home page and looks the same as before, the pages it produces have a new look and feel that is more in keeping with the rest of the agency&#8217;s site.</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p align=\"center\">###</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p align=\"center\">&#160;</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p>&#160; </p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "date": "03/27/2006", "href": "press2006/20060327websearch.html", "category": "Disclosure Initiatives", "title": "FEC Upgrades Website Search Process", "pdf": null}
