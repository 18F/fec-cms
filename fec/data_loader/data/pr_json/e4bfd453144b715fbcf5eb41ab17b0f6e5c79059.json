SUTFIN...REP</p>\n<p>AR/02...ROD MARTIN FOR CONGRESS INC...LEAH MARTIN, TREAS...ROD D. MARTIN...REP</p>\n<p>ID/01...LINDA PALL CONGRESS 2000...MARY JO HAMILTON, TREAS...LINDA L. B. PALL...DEM</p>\n<p>KY/04...DON BELL FOR CONGRESS/2000...DEA J. WOODS, TREAS...DON BELL...REP</p>\n\n<p>\tThe reports were due by close-of-business May 11, and were to include financial activity from April 1 through May 3.  If sent by certified or registered mail, the reports should have been postmarked by May 8.</p>\n\n<p>\tSome individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state ballots.  If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n\n<p>\tThe FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential filing requirements on April 17.  Those committees which did not file on the due date were notified on May 12 that reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n\n<p>\tOther political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to file pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly.  Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n\n<p>\tFurther Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis.  Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil penalties ($5,500 for \"any violation\" and $11,000 for any \"knowing and willful\" violation).</p>\n\n<p>\tThe next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees will be the quarterly report, due July 15.  It will cover activity from May 4 through June 30.</p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"/>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></font></body>\n", "href": "nonfil05192000.htm", "date": "05/19/2000", "pdf": null, "title": "Campaigns Cited for Failure to File Pre-Primary Report", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
