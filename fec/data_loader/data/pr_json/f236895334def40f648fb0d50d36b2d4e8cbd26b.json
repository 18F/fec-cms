The Commission approved an advisory opinion based on a request from Make Your Laws PAC, Inc. (MYL). The Commission concluded that MYL may accept contributions of bitcoins as proposed, subject to valuation and reporting procedures detailed in the opinion. The Commission also concluded that Make Your Laws PAC may purchase bitcoins with funds from its campaign depository for investment purposes, but must return the funds to the depository before they are used to make disbursements. The Commission could not approve a response by the required four affirmative votes as to whether bitcoins received as contributions may be used to purchase goods and services.
