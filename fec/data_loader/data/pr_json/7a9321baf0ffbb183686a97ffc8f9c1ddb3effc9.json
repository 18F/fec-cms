FEC</em></a>. (formerly <em>Beam v. Gonzales</em>). On August 25, the trial in the <em>Beam</em> case began.&#160;&#160; Plaintiffs allege that the Commission violated the Right to Financial Privacy Act.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><em><a href=\"../../law/litigation/crew_complaint.pdf\">Citizens For Responsibility And Ethics In Washington (CREW) v.

The Final Rules add a new standard to the content prong of the coordination rules to cover public communications that are the functional equivalent of express advocacy. The final rules do not alter the conduct prong of the coordination rules, but provide further justification for retaining the 120-day time period in the common vendor and former employee conduct standards. The final rules adopt a new safe harbor for certain commercial and business communications. These final rules were promulgated in response to the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em><a href=\"../../law/litigation_CCA_S.shtml_06\">Shays v. FEC</a></em>, 528 F.3d 914 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The Final Rules go into effect on December 1, 2010.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>Commissioner Steven T.

The final rules revise the definitions of &#8220;voter registration activity&#8221; and &#8220;get-out-the-vote activity&#8221; (GOTV) to cover activities that urge, encourage or assist potential voters to register to vote, regardless of whether the message is delivered individually or to a group of people via mass communication. Brief, incidental exhortations to register to vote are exempt from the new definitions. The final rules clarify that certain voter identification and GOTV activities conducted solely in connection with a non-Federal election are not subject to the Commission&#8217;s Federal election activity regulations and provide that certain <em>de minimis</em> activities are not subject to the Federal election activity funding restrictions. These final rules were promulgated in response to the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em><a href=\"../../law/litigation_CCA_S.shtml_06\">Shays v. FEC</a></em>, 528 F.3d 914 (D.C. Cir. 2008).
