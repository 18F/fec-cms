An electioneering communication is a broadcast, cable or satellite communication that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate and is distributed within 30 days prior to a primary election or within 60 days prior to a general election. These communications do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a federal candidate.\n            </p>\n        <p align=\"left\">            The data summary table for electioneering communication filings submitted to the Commission through June 30, 2015 can be found <a href=\"../../summaries/2016/ElectionCycle/6m_IE_EC.shtml\">here</a>. </p>\n        \n        <p align=\"center\"><strong>VII. Communication Costs</strong> </p>\n        <p>A provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), allows corporations and labor organizations to communicate to a &#8220;restricted class&#8221; of individuals on any subject, including express advocacy of the election or defeat of any Federal candidate. The costs of such communications must be reported to the Commission when the cost exceeds $2,000 per election. This provision of the Act pre-dates the Supreme Court decision in <em>Citizens United v. FEC</em>, which struck down the ban on independent expenditures and electioneering communications financed by the general treasuries of corporations and labor unions. <br/>\n            <br/>\n  The Commission received one such filing during the reporting period, disclosing an organization&#8217;s spending of $5,095 in costs for a communication to its restricted class between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2015.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  The data summary table for communication cost filings submitted to the Commission through June 30, 2015 can be found <a href=\"../../summaries/2016/ElectionCycle/6m_IE_EC.shtml\">here</a>.<br/>\n  <br/>\n        </p>\n        <div align=\"center\"><em># # #</em></div>\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>      \n      </div>\n      ", "date": "09/25/2015", "href": "press2015/news_releases/20150925release.shtml", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries", "title": "Statistical Summary of Six-Month Campaign Activity of the 2015-2016 Election Cycle", "pdf": null}
