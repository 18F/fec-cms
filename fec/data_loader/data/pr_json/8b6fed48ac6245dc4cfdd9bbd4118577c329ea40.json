All respondents other than NJCTR replied that the complaint failed to present evidence that the advertisements at issue contained express advocacy and that the alleged coordination was not sufficient to convert the issue advocacy advertisements into contributions. NJCTR did not submit a response to the complaint. The Commission found probable cause to believe that Zimmer 2000, Inc., Larry Weitzner, Jamestown Associates, Tom Blakely, and Fox Media Consulting violated the law, but used its prosecutorial discretion to take no further action. Statements of Reasons were issued by Chairman Thomas and Commissioners Mason, McDonald and Weintraub. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p>&#160;</p>\n            <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5026  under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5367&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5367</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; U.

Rescue California, an unincorporated state ballot measure committee organized under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, fought to remove former California Governor Gray Davis from office through a recall process. Representative Issa stated that he did not violate the Act because, as a candidate for state office, his fundraising activities on behalf of Rescue California fall within the exception to the non-Federal funds ban. The Commission found reason to believe that both respondents violated the law. Since then, the Commission concluded in AO 2004-25 that the anti-corruption purpose of section 441i(e) is not furthered by restricting federal officeholders from donating their personal funds. Representative Issa provided information which demonstrated that he used his personal funds to make donations by the Greene Properties (a closely held corporation he owns with his wife). The Commission decided to take no further action. &#160;A Statement of Reasons was issued by Commissioner Weintraub. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>&#160;</p>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5367 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>      \n      <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      <b>\n</b><p>*There are four administrative stages to the FEC enforcement process:</p>\n    \n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"70%\">\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"50%\"><b>1.
