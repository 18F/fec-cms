The monies these committees receive are often\n    given to other federal candidates to gain support when the officeholder seeks a leadership\n    position in Congress, or used to subsidize the officeholders&#146; travel when campaigning\n    for other federal candidates. The monies may also be used to make contributions to party\n    committees, including state party committees in key states, or donated to candidates for\n    state and local office.</p>\n    <p>The Wednesday public hearing is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. in the 9th floor\n    hearing room of the FEC, 999 E. St. NW.
