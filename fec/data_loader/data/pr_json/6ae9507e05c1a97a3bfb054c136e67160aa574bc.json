If sent by registered mail, the\nreports should have been postmarked by February 23. Otherwise,\nthe due date was closeofbusiness February 26.\n</p><p>\nSome individuals and their committees have no obligation to file\nreports under federal election law, even though their names may\nappear on state ballots.  If an individual raises or spends less\nthan $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\"\nsubject to reporting under the FECA.\n</p><p>\nThe FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential\nfiling requirements on February 2.  Those committees which did\nnot file on the due date were notified on February 27 that reports\nhad not been received and that their names would be published\nif they did not respond within four business days.\n</p><p>\nOther political committees supporting Senate and House candidates\nin elections (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's\ncampaign) also are required to file preprimary reports, unless\nthey report monthly.  Those committee names are not published\nby the FEC.\n</p><p>\nFurther Commission action against nonfilers and late filers is\ndecided on a casebycase basis.  Federal law gives the FEC broad\nauthority to initiate enforcement actions, including the imposition\nof civil penalties ($5,000 for \"any violation\" and $10,000\nfor any \"knowing and willful\" violation).\n</p><p>\nThe next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate\ncommittees will be the quarterly report due April 15.  It will\ncover activity from February 19 through March 30..\n</p><p>\n# # #\n\n\n</p></body>", "date": "03/06/1998", "href": "nonfil.htm", "category": "Non-Filer Publications", "title": "Campaign Cited for Failure to File Pre-Primary Report", "pdf": null}
