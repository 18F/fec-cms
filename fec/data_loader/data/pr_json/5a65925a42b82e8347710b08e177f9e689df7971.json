In one matter, the Commission found probable cause to believe that a violation occurred, failed to resolve the matter through conciliation and obtained a consent judgment in federal court requiring payment of a $115,000 civil penalty. In another matter, the Commission declined either to find reason to believe that a violation occurred or to authorize a limited-scope investigation. In two matters, the Commission found no reason to believe violations had occurred. The Commission dismissed the fifth matter.</p>\n                <p/>\n                <p>Under the law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases, or MURs, through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group.
