The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is seeking comment on \n    whether to amend the definition of \"political committee\" applicable to \n    nonconnected committees. The Supreme Court in McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. \n    ---, 124 S. Ct. 619 (2003) recognized that regulation of certain activities \n    that affect Federal elections is a valid measure to prevent circumvention of \n    the Federal Election Campaign Act?s contribution limitations and \n    prohibitions. Consequently, the Commission is undertaking this rulemaking to \n    revisit the issue of whether the current definitions of \"political \n    committee\" adequately encompasses all organizations that should be \n    considered political committees subject to the limitations, prohibitions and \n    reporting requirements of the Act. A similar review of the definition of \n    \"expenditure\" and its implications, along with the rules for allocating \n    funds for activities involving both federal and nonfederal elections are \n    also a part of this rulemaking.<p>The notice of proposed rulemaking, which \n    can be found at http://www.fec.gov/register.htm [expired link] , \n    was published in the Federal Register on March 11, 2004. The Commission will \n    hold a public hearing on these proposed rules on April 14 and 15, 2004, at \n    10:00 a.m. Commenters wishing to testify at the hearing must submit their \n    request to testify along with their written or electronic comments by April \n    5, 2004. Commenters who do not wish to testify must submit their written or \n    electronic comments by April 9, 2004. </p>\n    <p>Electronic mail comments on this rulemaking are encouraged, and should be \n    addressed to Ms. Mai T. Dinh, Acting Assistant General Counsel, and sent to\n    <a href=\"mailto:politicalcommitteestatus@fec.gov\">\n    politicalcommitteestatus@fec.gov</a> and must include the full name, \n    electronic mail address, and postal service address of the commenter. Faxed \n    comments should be sent to (202) 219-3923, with printed copy follow-up to \n    ensure legibility. Written comments and printed copies of faxed comments \n    should be sent to the Federal Election Commission, 999 E Street, N.W., \n    Washington, D.C. 20463.</p>\n    <p>No final decisions have been made by the Commission on any of the \n    proposed revisions in this Notice.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\">###</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" colspan=\"3\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n"}
