Gephardt is seeking the Democratic nomination for \n    president in 2004.<p/>\n    <p>To become eligible for matching funds, candidates must raise a threshold \n    amount of $100,000 by collecting $5,000 in 20 different states in amounts no \n    greater than $250 from any individual. Other requirements to be declared \n    eligible include agreeing to an overall spending limit, abiding by spending \n    limits in each state, using public funds only for legitimate \n    campaign-related expenses, keeping financial records and permitting an \n    extensive campaign audit. </p>\n    <p>Based on documents filed by the Gephardt campaign on November 4, 2003, \n    contributions from the following states were verified for threshold \n    purposes: California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, \n    Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, \n    Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and \n    Virginia.</p>\n    <p>Once declared eligible, campaigns may submit additional contributions for \n    matching funds on the first business day of every month. The U.S. Treasury \n    Department will pay the FEC-certified amounts beginning in January 2004. The \n    maximum amount a candidate could receive is currently estimated to be $18.6 \n    million.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # # </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\" colspan=\"3\">&#160;\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "date": "12/02/2003", "href": "20031201matching_1.html", "category": "Presidential Public Funds", "title": "Gephardt Fourth Presidential Candidate Declared Eligible for Primary Matching Funds in 2004 Race", "pdf": null}
