This brings to 44 the total\n    number of cases released thus far. The program&#146;s goal is to expedite resolution of\n    some enforcement matters, reduce the cost of processing complaints, and enhance overall\n    FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available in the\n    FEC&#146;s Press and Public Records offices.<p>For a case to be considered for ADR\n    treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to\n    set aside the statute of limitations while the case is pending in the ADR Office, and\n    agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if necessary, mediation.</p>\n    <p>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching an expedient resolution\n    with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both satisfying to the respondent(s) and in\n    compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions reached through\n    direct and, when necessary, mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for\n    final approval. If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds\n    by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved through ADR are\n    not precedential.</p>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"9\" width=\"100%\">\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\">1.</th>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\">ADR # 046</th>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\"/>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\">RESPONDENTS:</th>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">(a) Ensign for Senate Committee, Linzel L.\n        McBride, treasurer<p>(b) Seven-Up Bottling Co. of Reno</p>\n        <p>(c) Custom Concrete Cutting Inc.</p>\n        <p>(d) Internet Auto Rent &amp; Sales, Inc.</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\">SOURCE:</th>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">MUR 5131 &#150; Complainant: Richard Daly</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\">SUBJECT:</th>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">Corporate contribution</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"small\">NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT:</th>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">(a) Respondents, in order to resolve this matter\n        and to avoid similar situations in the future agree to confirm that a member of the\n        respondents&#146; staff has been designated as the FEC compliance officer to supervise the\n        dissemination of the information and train staff and volunteers to ensure compliance with\n        the FECA and that the compliance officer will attend a FEC-sponsored seminar for candidate\n        committees during the 12 months following the effective date of this agreement.<p>(b-c)\n        Commission decided to dismiss this matter and direct the ADR Office to close the file.</p>\n        <p>(d) Respondent, in order to resolve this matter and to avoid similar situations in the\n        future agrees to distribute a memorandum to management personnel reiterating the\n        prohibitions on corporate contributions to candidates for federal office and gain\n        understanding of the prohibitions and requirements of the FECA before interacting with\n        candidates for federal office.</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"5%\"/>\n        <td width=\"30%\"/>\n        <td width=\"65%\"/>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "20021209adr.html", "date": "12/09/2002", "pdf": null, "title": "ADR Program Resolves Cases", "category": "Enforcement Matters"}
