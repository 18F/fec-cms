This reflects a 35% increase in fundraising when compared to the same 18-month period in the previous election cycle.  </p>\n<b/><p>\t</p>\n<p>\tThe increase in fundraising was apparent for both House and Senate candidates.  An analysis shows that House candidates raised $393 million, up 34% over the same period in 1997-98, and spent $233.3 million, a 27% increase.  Senate candidates raised $259.7 million, an increase of 36% over the same period in the previous election cycle, and spent $167.8 million, an increase of 42%. Cycle-to-cycle comparisons of Senate activity are difficult because, unlike House races, different seats in different states are up for election each cycle.   </p>\n\n<p>\tFurther examination of FEC statistics shows that fundraising was up for both Republican and Democratic House candidates when compared to the same period in the previous election cycle.  Republican House candidates raised $205.4 million, an increase of 32% compared to the same period in 1997-98.  Democratic House candidates raised $185.6 million, an increase of 36%.</p>\n\n<p>\tMedian receipts for all House candidates, except Republican challengers and  Democratic open seat races, have risen, as indicated in the chart on page 5.   Republican incumbents increased their median receipts by 21%, Democratic incumbents 27%.      </p>\n\n<p>\tContributions from individuals constituted the largest single source of funds for candidates, totaling $368.1 million, or 56% of all receipts.  PACs and other committees have contributed $155.6 million, representing 24% of receipts.  Candidates provided $98.2 million or 15% of all receipts.  </p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>Information provided in this report includes:</p>\n\n<p>***<a href=\"cansum1800.htm\">Overall summary of Senate and House activity based on political party and candidate  status</a>                            (Incumbent, challenger and open seat)  </p>\n<p>***18-month comparison of <a href=\"senlong1800.htm\"> Senate\n</a> and <a href=\"hselong1800.htm\"> House</a> activity for 1990 through 2000.</p>\n<p>***<a href=\"medhse1800.htm\">Median receipts for House candidates</a> and\n<a href=\"hsechal1800.htm\"> number of candidates who reported receipts of at least $50,000 by June 30 of the election year, by candidate\nstatus</a>. </p>\n<p>***Six-year financial summaries for <a href=\"../2000/state20.htm\"> current senate candidates.</a></p>\n<p>***18-month financial summaries of each <a href=\"../2000/state99.htm\"> House race.</a> </p>\n<p>***Rankings of Senate and House candidates for the following categories: receipts, contributions from individuals contributions from PACs, disbursements, cash-on-hand, and debts.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"senrec1800.htm\">Top 50 Senate - Receipts</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"senind1800.htm\">Contributions from\nIndividuals</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"senpac1800.htm\">Contributions from PAC's</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"sendisb1800.htm\">Disbursements</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"sencash1800.htm\">Cash-on-Hand</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"sendebt1800.htm\">Debts</a></p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"hserec1800.htm\">Top 50 House - Receipts</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"hseind1800.htm\">Contributions from\nIndividuals</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"hsepac1800.htm\">Contributions from PAC's</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"hsedisb1800.htm\">Disbursements</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"hsecash1800.htm\">Cash-on-Hand</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"hsedebt1800.htm\">Debts</a></p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This release and the data contained in it are also available on the FEC&#146;s web page at <i>http://www.fec.gov</i> under News Releases or Campaign Finance Reports and Data.</p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"/>\n<p align=\"CENTER\">&#160;</p></body>\n", "date": "09/26/2000", "href": "can1800text.htm", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries", "title": "Congressional Campaign Receipts Reach $653 Million", "pdf": null}
