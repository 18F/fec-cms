FEC</em>.</p>\n      <p>Electioneering communications are broadcast, cable or satellite communications that refer to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office, are publicly distributed within 60 days before a general election or 30 days before a primary election, and are targeted to the relevant electorate.&#160; Such communications carry certain reporting obligations and funding restrictions.&#160;The proposed changes would modify the definition of &#8220;publicly distributed&#8221; and also the exemptions to the definition of &#8220;electioneering communication.&#8221;</p>\n      <p> In modifying the existing regulations the Commission is considering a range of options:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>retaining the section 501(c)(3) exemption and the state candidate exemption</li>\n        <li>narrowing the section 501(c)(3) exemption</li>\n        <li>repealing the current exemptions for section 501(c)(3) organizations and state candidates</li>\n        <li>replacing all the current exemptions with a broad new exemption covering all communications that do not promote, support, attack, or oppose a federal candidate </li>\n      </ul>      \n      <p>No final decision has been made by the Commission on the issues presented in this rulemaking.&#160; The Notice was published in the Federal Register on August 23, 2005 (70 FR 49508) and can be found at <a href=\"../../pdf/nprm/exemption_doc_films/notice_2005-20.pdf\">http://www.fec.gov/pdf/nprm/exemption_doc_films/notice_2005-20.pdf</a>.</p>\n      <p>&#160; Comments are due on September 30, 2005.&#160; A hearing on the proposed rules will be held on October 19, 2005.</p>\n      <p>All comments must be in writing, must be addressed to Ms. Mai T.
