GORDON...DEM</p>\n      <p>MS/01....FRIENDS OF ROGER WICKER 2002...JOHN P. NAIL, TREAS...ROGER F. WICKER...REP</p>\n      <p>MT..........MONTANA FOR JOHNSON...CHRIS BAKWIN, TREAS...BRADLEY S. JOHNSON...REP</p>\n      <p>NJ/07.....ROSS FOR CONGRESS...VERONICA MCLEOD, TREAS...TYRONE C. ROSS...DEM</p>\n      <p>NM/02..COMMITTEE FOR ANDY KISSNER...LARRY DOWNUM, TREAS...JON A. KISSNER...REP</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The reports were to include financial activity occurring from April 1 through May 15.\n    If sent by certified or registered mail, the reports should have been postmarked by May\n    20. Otherwise, the due date was close-of-business May 23. Mandatory electronic filing\n    requirements became effective as of January 1, 2001. Any committee required to file with\n    the FEC that receives contributions or makes expenditures in excess of $50,000 in the\n    current calendar year, or that reasonably expects to do so, must submit its reports\n    electronically. These rules became effective for reporting periods beginning on or after\n    January 1, 2001.</p>\n    <p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal\n    election law, even though their names may appear on state ballots. If an individual raises\n    or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to\n    reporting under the FECA.</p>\n    <p>The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential filing\n    requirements on April 29. Those committees which did not file on the due date were\n    notified on May 24 that reports had not been received and that their names would be\n    published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n    <p>Other political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those\n    which are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to file\n    pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names are not published\n    by the FEC.</p>\n    <p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a\n    case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement\n    actions and the FEC has implemented a new administrative fine program which will subject\n    committees to penalties ranging from $125 to $16,000 or more.</p>\n    <p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for these candidate committees will be\n    the quarterly report, due July 15, 2002. It will cover activity from May 16 through June\n    30.</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"100%\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "date": "05/31/2002", "href": "20020531nonfiler.html", "category": "Non-Filer Publications", "title": "Campaigns Cited for Failure To File Pre-Primary Report", "pdf": null}
