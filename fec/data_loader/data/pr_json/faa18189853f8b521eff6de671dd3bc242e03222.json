The Commission did agree, however, that the proposed rental program would not result in either a coordinated expenditure or a coordinated communication. The Commission directed the Office of the General Counsel to redraft the advisory opinion reflecting these conclusions.</p>\n        <p>The Commission elected Cynthia L. Bauerly as Chair and Caroline C. Hunter as Vice Chair for 2011. Bauerly and Hunter have both served as Commissioners since 2008, following their nomination by former President George W. Bush and unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate. </p>\n        <p>The Commission also approved a <a href=\"../agenda/2010/mtgdoc1081.pdf\">schedule</a> of meeting dates for 2011.</p>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. </em></p>\n        <p align=\"center\"># # # </p>        <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n", "date": "12/16/2010", "href": "20101216OpenMeeting.shtml", "category": "Open Meetings and Related Matters", "title": "FEC Approves Advisory Opinion, Elects 2011 Officers", "pdf": null}
