Unity08, a group that sought to nominate and elect a bipartisan ticket for President and Vice President in the 2008 elections, challenged a Commission advisory opinion that advised Unity08 that it would have to register as a political committee once it made more than $1,000 in expenditures. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals applied to Unity08 its own previous interpretation of the &#8220;major purpose&#8221; test from <em>FEC v. Machinists Non-Partisan Political League</em>, 655 F.2d 380 (D.C. Cir. 1981) as \"limited to groups who have a 'clearly identified' candidate,\" and found that Unity08 could not be subject to regulation as a political committee under the Federal Election Campaign Act.</p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><a href=\"../../law/litigation/fieger_08.shtml\"><em>Fieger v.
