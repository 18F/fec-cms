The matter stemmed from the criminal case of Thomas W. Noe, a party fundraiser supporting Bush-Cheney &#8217;04, Inc. On May 31, 2006, Mr. Noe pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio to charges of conspiracy, making illegal campaign contributions and causing a false statement to be made to the FEC. As such, the Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion to take no further action against Mr. Noe because he was convicted of criminal charges relating to the same conduct.</p>\n                <p/></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"22%\" valign=\"top\"><p>OUTCOME:</p></td>\n            <td width=\"77%\" valign=\"top\"><p>The Commission admonished and took no further action against 18 respondents and signed conciliation agreements with seven respondents.</p>\n                <p>In conciliation agreements, the respondents agreed to the following civil penalties: </p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>Joseph F.
