The NRCC violated the Act by making the transfer \n    to USFN knowing that USFN planned to transfer at least some of the funds to \n    a third party to pay for issue ads in the 2000 election cycle. As part of \n    the conciliation agreement, the NRCC agreed to pay a $280,000 civil penalty.<p>\n    Under the law in effect at the time, the NRCC was required to pay for issue \n    ads with a minimum of 65% hard money. A party committee could not give \n    nonfederal funds to a third party to pay for such an ad, and could not \n    simply transfer funds to another group to run the ads.</p>\n    <p>In the fall of 1999, USFN solicited $500,000 in soft money from the NRCC \n    to pay for \"media and grassroots.\" After initially denying these requests, \n    the NRCC donated $500,000 to USFN without following its usual procedures to \n    approve and process large donations. Prior to the donation, Ed Buckham, the \n    founder of USFN, had agreed with Jim Ellis, who was affiliated with \n    Americans for Economic Growth (AEG), that AEG would run radio ads accusing \n    Democrats of planning to raid the Social Security Trust Fund surplus. After \n    receiving the NRCC's $500,000 donation, USFN transferred $300,000 to AEG. \n    AEG then spent approximately $260,000 for two sets of radio ads criticizing \n    Democratic efforts to spend portions of the Social Security surplus on \n    \"foreign aid and big government programs.\"</p>\n    <p>The NRCC knew through its agents that USFN planned to pass all or part of \n    the $500,000 to a third party to pay for party issue advertisements. \n    Therefore, the NRCC violated the Act by using only soft money to pay for \n    activity that should have been allocated between their hard and soft money \n    accounts.</p>\n    <p>The investigation stemmed from a complaint filed by David Plouffe, \n    Executive Director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. </p>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">1.</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">MUR 4953</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">RESPONDENTS:</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">(a) National Republican Congressional \n        Committee, Christopher J.
