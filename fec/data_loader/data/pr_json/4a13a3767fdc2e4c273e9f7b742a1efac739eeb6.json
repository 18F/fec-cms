Based on the complaint and responses, the Commission found indications that corporate contributions may have been raised improperly through joint fundraising among McCollum&#8217;s Senate campaign committee, the NRSC, and the Republican Party of Florida (RPOF).&#160; The available information did not, however show that the Victory Committee or its participants raised or received corporate contributions in conjunction with the Victory Committee&#8217;s fundraiser to benefit McCollum&#8217;s 2000 Senate campaign, or that they engaged in joint fundraising activities with the RPOF. The Commission found reason to believe that the McCollum Victory Committee, the NRSC and RPOF failed to enter into a written joint fundraising agreement which identified the fundraising representative and stating a formula for the allocation of the proceeds, but decided to take no further action in light of the fact the Commission could not find any evidence that the participants raised corporate contributions at the fundraiser the complaint was based upon.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\"><p>Documents from these matters are available from the \n              Commission's web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering \n              5094 under case number.

The complainant also alleged in a supplement to the initial complaint that the Federal committee sent out a mailing and e-mail that did not contain the required disclaimers. The Commission found no reason to believe that the Respondents violated the prohibition against the use of non-federal funds by virtue of qualifying for the state candidate exemption. Furthermore, the Commission found no reason to believe the Respondents violated the law by failing to include a disclaimer on an e-mail referred to by the complainant. The Commission did find reason to believe the Respondents violated the law by failing to include a disclaimer on a letter sent by the committee. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td><p>Documents from these matters are available from the Commission's \n              web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering 5411 \n              under case number.
