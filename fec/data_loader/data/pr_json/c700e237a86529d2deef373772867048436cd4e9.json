The Commission discussed the advisory opinion request at its open meeting on August 23, then held a tally vote on the draft advisory opinion yesterday.<br/>\n            <br/>\n            <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=year&amp;YEAR=2012\">Advisory Opinion 2012-30 (Revolution Messaging, LLC)</a>. The Commission concluded that the requestor&#8217;s proposal (1) to enable the processing of contributions by text message to a political committee in excess of $50 per billing cycle and $200 per calendar year or election cycle, and (2) to use shared premium short codes by multiple federal committees to process contributions by text message complies with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, and Commission regulations. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><br/>\n          <em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
