Jones concerning a disclaimer and failing to report an independent expenditure. </p>\n      <p> This brings to 247 the total number of cases released since the ADR program began October 2, 2000. The program&#8217;s goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement matters, reduce the cost of processing complaints, and enhance overall FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available in the FEC&#8217;s Press and Public Records offices.</p>\n      <p align=\"left\"> For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is pending in the ADR Office, and agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if necessary, mediation.</p>\n      <p>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching an expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both satisfying to the respondent(s) and in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA).&#160; Resolutions reached through direct and, when necessary, mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval. If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved through ADR are not precedential.</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p/>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=251&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">ADR 251 </a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p> Libertarian National Committee, David M.

The current treasurer was not the treasurer at the time of the omission. The Committee contends that, in addition to an experienced treasurer, it hired personnel knowledgeable in campaign finance issues and overhauled the entire financial accounting system, including replacement of the financial software. Respondents also assert they hired a FECA Compliance Specialist to review reports before they are filed with the Commission. Respondents, in an effort to avoid similar errors in the future, also agree to conduct an internal review (desk audit) of the compliance system annually. The annual review will include a review of the electronic accounting system to ensure that it accurately interfaces with the Commission&#8217;s electronic filing system. The completion of the desk audit will be verified with the Commission within 30 days of its conclusion for the next two years.  </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD: </strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at http://www.fec.gov by entering 251 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FECs Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>2.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=287&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">ADR 287</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>Marsha Blackburn for Congress, Inc., Tea Hoffman, treasurer </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SOURCE:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>FEC Initiated (RAD) </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>Failure to disclose all receipts and disbursements </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>$1,500 civil penalty</p>\n          Respondents acknowledge an inadvertent violation of FECA, based in part on inexperienced staff.
