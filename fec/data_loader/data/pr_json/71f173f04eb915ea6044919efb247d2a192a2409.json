Dean is seeking the Democratic\n    nomination for president in 2004.<p>To become eligible for matching funds, candidates must\n    raise a threshold amount of $100,000 by collecting $5,000 in 20 different states in\n    amounts no greater than $250 from any individual. Other requirements to be declared\n    eligible include agreeing to an overall spending limit, abiding by spending limits in each\n    state, using public funds only for legitimate campaign-related expenses, keeping financial\n    records and permitting an extensive campaign audit. </p>\n    <p>Based on documents filed by the Dean campaign on June 17, 2003, contributions from the\n    following states were verified for threshold purposes: California, Colorado, Connecticut,\n    District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,\n    Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode\n    Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.</p>\n    <p>Once declared eligible, campaigns may submit additional contributions for matching\n    funds on the first business day of every month. The U.S. Treasury Department will pay the\n    FEC-certified amounts beginning in January 2004. The maximum amount a candidate could\n    receive is currently estimated to be $18.6 million.</p>\n    <p>Go to the <a href=\"../finance/2004matching/matching.html\">2004 Presidential Campaign\n    Matching Fund Summissions</a> page for more details.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # # </p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" checked=\"false\" colspan=\"3\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "20030707matching.html", "date": "07/07/2003", "pdf": null, "title": "Dean First Presidential Candidate Declared Eligible for Primary Matching Funds in 2004 Race", "category": "Presidential Public Funds"}
