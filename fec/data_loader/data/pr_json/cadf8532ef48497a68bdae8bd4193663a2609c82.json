On December 16, the Commission approved Advisory Opinion 2010-29. The Commission concluded that Working Families Party of Oregon qualifies as a state committee of a political party under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), and Commission regulations.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><u>Advisory Opinion Considered</u></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=ao&amp;AO=3137\">AO 2010-30 (Citizens United).</a> On December 16, the Commission could not render an opinion on whether the proposed rental of email lists to federal candidates, authorized committees, political party committees or other political committees for emails soliciting contributions or inviting recipients to fundraisers would constitute a prohibited corporate facilitation of contributions. The Commission did agree, however, that the proposed rental program would not result in either a coordinated expenditure or a coordinated communication. The Commission directed the Office of the General Counsel to redraft the advisory opinion reflecting these conclusions.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><u>Concurring Statement Issued</u></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=ao&amp;AO=3108\">AO 2010-19 (Google, Inc.)</a>.
