The Commission approved meeting dates for 2015. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"2015ElectionofOfficers.shtml\">Election of Officers</a>. The Commission elected Ann M. Ravel as Chair and Matthew S. Petersen as Vice Chairman. Commissioner Ravel has served on the Commission since October 2013, and she served as Vice Chair in 2014. Commissioner Petersen joined the Commission in 2008, and he has served in both the positions of Chairman and Vice Chairman.&#160; <br/>\n            <br/>\n  Chairman Goodman remarked, &#8220;2014 has been a productive year at the Commission. We needed to update our regulations and we did. We embraced new technologies. &#160;We helped political parties fund their conventions and held a forum on how political parties can be more effective democratic institutions. We debated a range of important policy issues about our democratic system. &#160;And we acted by a majority vote on 93 percent of all voting matters voted on by the Commission, pretty good for a bipartisan commission.&#8221; </p>\n        <p>&#160;</p>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency.
