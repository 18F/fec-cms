Spending from January 1, 1997,\nthrough October 14, 1998 rose to $480 million. Candidates began the last 20 days of the\ncampaign with $179 million cash-on-hand. </p>\n\n<p>Factors which may have influenced the slowdown include fewer open-seat races and fewer\ncompetitive districts. Activity in open-seat races, which are typically the most\ncompetitive and most expensive, is down by nearly half when compared to the last election.\nThere are only five open-seat Senate races this year rather than the record-setting 13 in\n1996, and only 32 open-seat House races, compared with 51 two years ago. One indication of\nthe decline in competitiveness can be found in median activity of House Democratic\nchallengers - median spending is down 25%, and median receipts are down 10%.</p>\n\n<p>In the 34 Senate races, 83 candidates raised $215 million and spent $195 million. This\nactivity represents a 14% increase in fundraising over &#146;96 levels and a 16% increase\nin spending. Individuals contributed $135 million, PACs $40 million, and the candidates\nthemselves $23 million. Senate candidates entered the last days of the campaign with $46\nmillion cash-on-hand.</p>\n\n<p>In House races, 928 candidates raised $361 million and spent $285 million. This\nrepresents a decline of 3% in receipts and 5% decline in spending over the last election\ncycle. The breakdown of their funds shows $195 million from individuals, $128 million from\nPACs, and $22 million from the candidates. They had $133 million on hand for the final\nweeks before the election.</p>\n\n<p>Fifty-seven percent of the funding for this year&#146;s general election candidates\ncame from individual contributions ($329 million), 29% from PACs ($167 million), and only\n8% from the candidates themselves ($46 million), mostly in the form of loans.</p>\n\n<p>Tallies for <u>all</u> Congressional candidates From January 1, 1997, through September\n30, 1998, (including primary losers and Special Election activity) reveal a total of $640\nmillion raised and $498 million spent. These figures represent a 4% increase in\nfundraising over &#146;96, and a 2% increase in spending.</p>\n\n<p>Information attached to this release offers overall summary data by political party, as\nwell as by candidate status (incumbent, challenger, open-seat), comparable pre-general\nelection summary figures for the past five election cycles, a six-year overview of each\nSenate campaign, listings of each House race, and candidate rankings. A special table is\nincluded with median receipt and disbursement figures for various categories of House\ncandidates, and because of increased interest in the amounts of personal funds, a ranking\nof those campaigns with the largest amounts.</p>\n\n<p>This release and the data contained in it are also available on the Internet.
