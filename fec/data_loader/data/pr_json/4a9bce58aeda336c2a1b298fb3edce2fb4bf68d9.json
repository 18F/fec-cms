If sent by certified or registered  mail, the report should have been postmarked by July 20, 2016.<br/>\n  <br/>\n          Some individuals and their committees  have no obligation  to file reports under federal campaign  finance law, even though their names  may  appear on state ballots. If an individual raises or spends  $5,000 or less, he or she is  not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the  Act.<br/>\n  <br/>\n          The Commission notified committees  involved in Tennessee&#8217;s Primary  Election of their potential filing requirements on June 29, 2016. Those committees that  did not file by the due date were sent  notification on July 25,  2016, that their reports had  not been received and  that  their names would be published if they did  not respond within four business  days.<br/>\n  <br/>\n          Other political committees  that support Senate and  House candidates in elections,  but are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign, are also required to file quarterly reports, unless  they report monthly. Those committee names  are  not published by the FEC.<br/>\n  <br/>\n          Further Commission  action against non-filers  and  late filers is decided on a  case-by-case basis.  Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement  actions, and the FEC has implemented  an Administrative Fine program  with provisions for assessing monetary penalties.<br/>\n  <em><br/>\n  <br/>\n    The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is  an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has  jurisdiction over the  financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives,  the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six  Commissioners who  are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S.  Senate.</em></p>\n        <div align=\"center\"><br/>\n        </div>\n        <blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>\n          <blockquote><blockquote>\n            <div align=\"center\"><em># #  # </em></div>\n          </blockquote>\n              </blockquote>\n            </blockquote>\n          </blockquote>\n</blockquote></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>      \n      </div>\n      "}
