Non-connected PACs (those which are not connected to or sponsored by a corporation or labor organization, and which are not related to a candidate's campaign or to a political party organization) must register within 10 days after certain financial activity exceeds $1,000 during a calendar year. </p>\n<p>\tRegistration does not necessarily imply financial activity. Many PACs report making no contributions to candidates or independent expenditures on behalf of or against candidates. Financial information on PACs will be included in future FEC news releases.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"pacchart.htm\"> following chart</a> details the number of PACs in existence since the end of 1974.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p></body>\n", "href": "paccnt1_2000.htm", "date": "01/14/2000", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Issues Semi-Annual Federal PAC Count", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries"}
