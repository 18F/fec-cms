Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL)</em>. Under the Commission&#8217;s final rules, adopted November 20, corporations and unions may pay for &#8220;electioneering communications&#8221; that qualify for the <em>WRTL</em> exemption, but must file disclosure reports and include disclaimers on the ads.&#160; The Explanation and Justification includes examples illustrating types of communications that would or would not fall within the <em>WRTL</em> exemption.&#160; </p>\n              <p>The Commission also approved final rules to implement a portion of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA) regulating the travel of federal candidates on non-commercial aircraft.&#160; Under the rules approved by the Commission, Presidential, Vice-Presidential and Senate candidates, or anyone traveling on behalf of their campaign or leadership political action committee&#8217;s, must pay the pro-rata share of the &#8220;normal and usual charter fare or rental charge for travel on a comparable aircraft of comparable size&#8221; for each campaign traveler when using non-commercial, non-government-owned aircraft.&#160;&#160; The same rate also applies to anyone traveling on behalf of a political party or non-candidate political committee.&#160; House candidates or anyone traveling on their behalf are prohibited from using non-commercial aircraft for campaign travel.</p>\n              <p>The FEC also approved:</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Advisory Opinion 2007-31, concluding that contributions to John Edwards for President that are processed through ActBlue may not be matched with public funds under the Presidential Public Funding program.&#160; The Commission noted that earmarked contributions that ActBlue forwards to John Edwards for President by check drawn on ActBlue&#8217;s account fall squarely within a category of contributions that both the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act and Commission regulations specifically exclude from qualifying for matching funds.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Advisory Opinion 2007-27, concluding that ActBlue may not solicit, receive and forward contributions from the general public to corporate or union PACs.&#160; However, ActBlue may solicit, receive and forward contributions from the restricted classes of corporations and unions to their separate segregated funds (SSFs, or PACs), subject to applicable contribution limits.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Advisory Opinion 2007-34, concluding that Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. (IL/2) may appear on a billboard endorsing a nonfederal candidate because the billboard would not be a coordinated communication under FEC regulations.&#160; </li>\n              </ul>\n              <ul>\n                <li>A response in Advisory Opinion 2007-28, indicating that although the Commission was unable to reach a majority opinion with a single rationale, all Commissioners agreed that the proposal from Representatives Kevin McCarthy (CA/22) and Devin Nunes (CA/21) to solicit funds for ballot measure committees involved in the qualification and passage of a redistricting ballot initiative was permissible to the extent it was limited to solicitations of up to $20,000 from individuals.&#160; Separate opinions from the Commissioners explaining the split-decision are forthcoming. </li>\n              </ul>\n              <p/>\n              <p>Finally, the Commission was unable to approve an Advisory Opinion by the required four-vote majority in response to a request from Holland &amp; Knight, LLP regarding its status as a corporation or a partnership for the purpose of administering and financially supporting a PAC.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p/>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
