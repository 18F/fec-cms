House candidates, and their campaigns and Leadership PACs, are prohibited from spending any campaign funds for travel on private, non-commercial aircraft. </p>\n              <p>The FEC seeks comment from the public on proposals to implement the new travel restrictions in HLOGA. The NPRM also proposes, and seeks comment on, a definition of the term Leadership PAC.&#160; </p>\n              <p>The NPRM will be published in the Federal Register next week, and a public comment period will follow. The deadline for public comment will be November 13, 2007. The FEC will hold a hearing on November 15, 2007, for those wishing to testify before the Commission. Directions for submitting written comments and requests to testify are provided in the notice. The Commission plans to vote on a final rule before the end of December.
