MORAN, TREAS...MARK DETRO...REP</p>\n<p>OK/02...TROUTT FOR CONGRESS...H. P. FERGUSON, TREAS...ERIC D. TROUTT...REP</p>\n<p>OK/04...SUSAN DUCEY FOR CONGRESS...ROBERT WRIGHT, TREAS...SUSAN G. DUCEY...REP</p>\n\n</font></b><font face=\"Book Antiqua\" size=\"3\"><p>\tThe reports were to include financial activity occurring from July 1 through August 2.  If sent by certified or registered mail, the reports should have been postmarked by August 7. Otherwise, the due date was close-of-business August 10.</p>\n\n<p>\tSome individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state ballots.  If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n\n<p>\tThe FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential filing requirements on July 17.  Those committees which did not file on the due date were notified on<b> </b>August 11 that reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n\n<p>\tOther political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to file pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly.  Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n\n<p>\tFurther Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis.  Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions and the FEC has implemented a new administrative fine program which will subject committees to penalties ranging from $125 to $16,000 or more.</p>\n\n<p>\tThe next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees will be the third quarterly report, due October 15.  It will cover activity from August 3 through September 30<b>.</b></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"/>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></font></body>\n"}
