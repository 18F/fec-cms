CA). The FEC has entered \n    into conciliation agreements with PAC to the Future and Team Majority, and \n    three campaigns that were recipients of excessive contributions. </p>\n    <p>The conciliation agreements resulted in total civil penalties of $28,000. \n    PAC to the Future and Team Majority will pay $21,000, Julie Thomas for \n    Congress Campaign Committee (D ? IA) and Van Hollen for Congress (D ? MD) \n    will each pay $2,500, and Joe Turnham for Congress (D ? AL) will pay $2,000. \n    The three campaigns have also agreed to disgorge $5,000 each to the U.S. \n    Treasury.</p>\n    <p>The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) states that committees that are \n    established, financed, maintained, or controlled by the same person or group \n    of persons are \"affiliated committees.\" Contributions made to or by such \n    committees shall be considered to have been made to or by a single \n    committee. Under the FECA, a multicandidate PAC is limited to receiving \n    $5,000 per calendar year from individual contributors. Further, a candidate \n    may only accept $5,000 per election from a multicandidate PAC. If a \n    committee accepts contributions that exceed these limits, its treasurer must \n    either refund the excessive contributions or seek redesignation to another \n    election or reattribution to another donor within sixty days.</p>\n    <p>According to the conciliation agreement with PAC to the Future and Team \n    Majority, the PACs failed to identify themselves as affiliated with each \n    other when they registered with the FEC, and both PACs made contributions to \n    several candidates for the 2002 General Election, which, when aggregated, \n    exceeded their shared $5,000 contribution limit . The PACs also received \n    contributions from individuals that exceeded their shared $5,000 \n    contribution limit and did not refund the excessive portion of contributions \n    within 60 days. </p>\n    <p>The investigation stemmed from a complaint filed by Kenneth F. Boehm, \n    Chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center. </p>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">1.</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">MUR 5328</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">RESPONDENTS:</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">(a) PAC to the Future, Leo McCarthy, \n        treasurer<p>(b) Team Majority, Leo McCarthy, treasurer</p>\n        <p>(c) Julie Thomas for Congress Campaign Committee, Stephen B.
