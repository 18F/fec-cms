The hearing was part of a rulemaking process in response to the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em><a href=\"../../law/litigation_CCA_S.shtml#shays_06\">Shays v. FEC</a></em>, 528 F.3d 914 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The Commission is also considering the potential effect of the recent Supreme Court decision in <em><a href=\"../../law/litigation_CCA_C.shtml#citizensunited\">Citizens United v. FEC</a></em>, 558 U.S. ___ (2010) on the Commission&#8217;s proposals on the coordinated communications rulemaking.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>The Commission heard testimony from <a href=\"../../pages/hearings/coordinationshays3hearing.shtml\">11 witnesses</a>, including representatives of national party committees, unions, business federations, and nonprofit organizations; representatives of campaign finance education and reform organizations; and other campaign finance practitioners. Testimony focused on how to address the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals&#8217; view that the Commission&#8217;s prior coordination rules -- which govern communications made in coordination with Federal candidates, their authorized committees, or political parties, but paid for by others -- did not &#8220;rationally separate election-related advocacy from other speech.&#8221; Witnesses discussed the applicability of the several proposed content standards, including a standard based on whether a communication &#8220;promotes, supports, attacks or opposes&#8221; (PASO) a candidate and a standard based on the Supreme Court&#8217;s test for the &#8220;functional equivalent of express advocacy&#8221; established in <em>Wisconsin Right to Life v. FEC, </em>551 U.S. 449 (2007) (WRTL).&#160;Witnesses also weighed alternatives for timeframes applicable to the conduct standard regarding common vendors and former employees. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>The Commission sought comment on these issues through a <a href=\"../../pdf/nprm/coord_commun/2009/notice_2009-23.pdf\">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </a>&#160;and <a href=\"../../pdf/nprm/coord_commun/2009/notice2010-01.pdf\">Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</a> addressing its proposed rules regarding coordinated communications at 11 CFR 109.21.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>&#8220;I would like to express appreciation on behalf of the Commission for the numerous comments we have received, which will be extraordinarily helpful as we tackle this complex rulemaking,&#8221; said Chairman Matthew S. Peterson.<br/>\n            <br/>\n  He announced that the deadline for submission of written comments would be extended until Wednesday, March 17.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>A complete audio file of the hearing will be available <a href=\"../../audio/audio.shtml\">here</a>.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"906\" valign=\"top\"><p><em><br/>\n        The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
