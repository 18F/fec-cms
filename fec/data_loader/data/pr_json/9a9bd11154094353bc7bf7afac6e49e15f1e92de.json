The Commission found reason to believe that the Friends, Swing States and Mr. DeWald violated the Act by using information from Commission disclosure reports to solicit contributions and sent admonishment letters but took no further action because these possible violations did not warrant the use of additional Commission resources, and because Mr. DeWald had been convicted in state court on related matters. &#160;The Commission found reason to believe that TRKC, Inc. may have violated the law regarding the possible sale of information from FEC disclosure reports, but took no further action after being provided with information suggesting that their activities did not violate the law. The Commission found no reason to believe that the Friends committee violated the law regarding registering and reporting and fraudulent misrepresentation because it properly filed its Statement of Organization and it was not an agent of the Gore campaign. </p>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5155 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>2.</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5641&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5641</a></strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"104\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"391\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Robert Shrum</p>\n            <p>(b)&#160;&#160; John Kerry For President, Inc., David Thorne, treasurer</p>\n            (c)&#160;&#160; Shrum Devine &amp; Donilon, Inc. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"104\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"391\" valign=\"top\"><p> The Gordon Motion Picture Company  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"104\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"391\" valign=\"top\"><p> Contract dispute/not FECA related  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>DISPOSITION:</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a-c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Dismiss the complaint</p>\n            <p/>\n            <p>The complainant alleged that Robert Shrum, his political consulting company, Shrum Devine &amp; Donilon, Inc., and Kerry for President breached a contract they entered into with the Gordon Motion Picture Company.
