The Commission concluded that Wawa Inc.&#8217;s area and general managers are members of its restricted class because they are part of its &#8220;executive or administrative personnel.&#8221; Although the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) prohibits direct corporate contributions in connection with federal election campaigns, it permits corporations to solicit voluntary contributions from their restricted class to a separate segregated fund that in turn may be used to make contributions. The Commission concluded, therefore, that Wawa Inc. may solicit area and general managers for voluntary contributions to its separate segregated fund. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=ao&amp;AO=3410\">Advisory Opinion Request 2012-04 (Justice Party of Mississippi)</a>. The Commission discussed then held over an advisory opinion request from the Justice Party of Mississippi (JPMS). During today&#8217;s discussion, the Commission heard from a representative of JPMS regarding its request to determine whether JPMS constitutes a state political party committee as defined in the Act and Commission regulations. The Commission has until 60 days after receipt of the completed request, that is, by March 19, 2012, to issue a response. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
