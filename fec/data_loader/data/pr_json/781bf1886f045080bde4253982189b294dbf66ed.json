In one matter, the Commission closed a case in connection with a Supreme Court ruling that sections of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 were unconstitutional.&#160; In three of the matters, the Commission found no reason to believe violations occurred and closed the files. The Commission dismissed the two final cases, issuing an admonishment in one for failure to file campaign reports in a timely manner. </p>\n        <p>Under the law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases, or MURs, through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group.Additional information regarding MURs can be found on the FEC web site at <a href=\"../../em/mur.shtml\">http://www.fec.gov/em/mur.shtml</a>. </p>\n        <p>This release contains only summary information.For additional details, please consult publicly available documents for each case in the Enforcement Query System (EQS) on the FEC web site at <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs</a>.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p/>\n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"36%\" valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 5728</a></p></td>\n            <td width=\"63%\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"36%\" valign=\"top\"><p>RESPONDENTS:</p></td>\n            <td width=\"63%\" valign=\"top\"><p>Friends of Jack Orchulli and Jack Orchulli in his official capacity as treasurer; and Jack Orchulli<strong/></p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"36%\" valign=\"top\"><p>COMPLAINANT:</p></td>\n            <td width=\"63%\" valign=\"top\"><p>FEC-initiated<strong/></p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"36%\" valign=\"top\"><p>SUBJECT:</p></td>\n            <td width=\"63%\" valign=\"top\"><p>The FEC alleged that Orchulli and his campaign committee failed to file 24-hour notices of personal expenditures in a timely fashion. <strong/></p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"36%\" valign=\"top\"><p>OUTCOME:</p></td>\n            <td width=\"63%\" valign=\"top\"><p>The Commission closed the case after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Davis v.
