The advisory opinion request was made public on May 12, 2006, and the Commission will accept public comments on the request for the statutorily-required 10-day comment period, through May 22, 2006.&#160; </p>\n      <p>Under the expedited process, the Office of General Counsel released the draft advisory opinion within 10 days of the public release of the request, and plans to circulate a draft for &#160;Commission consideration by tally vote at the close of the 10-day comment period.&#160;&#160; The expedited process is similar to the one the Commission recently followed in issuing Advisory Opinion 2006-16 (Campaign to Elect Nancy Detert).&#160; The FEC has implemented this expedited advisory opinion process to handle time and election sensitive requests.&#160; Drafts of advisory opinions are otherwise normally considered at regularly scheduled Commission meetings.&#160; </p>\n      <p/>\n      <p>The draft advisory opinion is available <a href=\"../../aos/2006/aor2006-19draft.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n      <p><strong>*</strong>Levin funds are donations allowable under state law, raised directly by the specific state or local party that intends to use them, and limited to no more than $10,000 in a calendar year from any \"person.\"&#160; (A \"person\" can include a corporation or union, if state law allows, but not a foreign national.) </p>\n      <p align=\"center\"><strong># # #</strong></p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p/></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "date": "05/18/2006", "href": "press2006/20060518ao.html", "category": "s ", "title": "FEC Releases Draft Advisory Opinion on California Primary Election Under Expedited Proces", "pdf": null}
