The Commission approved a draft interpretive rule that would clarify the Commission&#8217;s interpretation of its rules for determining the date of a special primary election as those rules apply to nominations conducted under New York Election Law, which vests special election nominating authority in the party committees. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov\">Advisory Opinion Request 2013-19 (Yamaha Motor Corporation, U.S.A.)</a>. The Commission discussed <a href=\"../../../agenda/2013/mtgdoc_13-51.pdf\">two drafts</a> responding to an advisory opinion request from Yamaha Motor Corporation U.S.A. but was unable to render an opinion by the required four affirmative votes. In its request, the requestor asked whether it may solicit contributions to its separate segregated fund from the executive and administrative personnel of the dealers and service centers that sell and service Yamaha's marine products, and from such dealers and service centers that are individuals or partnerships. During the discussion, the Commission heard from counsel on behalf of the requestor.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><em/></p>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
