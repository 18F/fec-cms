Snapper; Patricia D. Cornwell; and Anchin, Block &amp; Anchin LLP<br/>\n          SUBJECT:&#160; The accounting and business management firm Anchin, Block &amp; Anchin LLP notified the Commission that Snapper, its former principal, had used funds of Cornwell, a former client, to reimburse contributions made by others to three campaign committees.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission entered into a conciliation agreement providing for Snapper to pay a civil penalty of $65,000. The Commission entered into a separate conciliation agreement providing for Cornwell to pay a civil penalty of $6,500. The Commission closed the matter in connection with Anchin, Block and Anchin LLP. </p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6717</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: Daniel Epstein, Executive Director, Cause of Action<br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: DNC Services Corporation/Democratic National Committee and Andrew Tobias, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that the DNC Services Corporation/Democratic National Committee and Tobias, in his official capacity as treasurer, (DNC) failed to disclose the receipt of a contribution from or debt to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for $2,514.50 in travel costs of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and an aide to an event in 2012 where Sebelius gave a speech in which she expressly advocated the election of President Barack Obama. The complaint alleged further that the DNC failed to disclose its payments of the $2,514.50 to HHS as independent expenditures in view of Sebelius&#8217;s express advocacy. The complaint also alleged that the DNC insufficiently disclosed the purpose of the payments at issue as &#8220;travel.&#8221;<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe the DNC received or failed to disclose a contribution from HHS because the Federal Government and its authorities do not fall under the definition of a &#8220;person&#8221; that can make a contribution under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) or Commission regulations. The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the allegation that the DNC failed to disclose independent expenditures in light of the <em>de minimis</em> amount at issue. Finally, the Commission found no reason to believe the DNC failed to adequately disclose the purpose of the payments at issue because the Commission has identified &#8220;travel&#8221; as an adequate purpose in its regulation and its Statement of Policy on the purpose of disbursement entries.</p>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6726</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANTS: Public Citizen; Oil Change International; Friends of the Earth-US; and Greenpeace USA<br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: Chevron Corporation; Chevron U.S.A., Inc.; and Congressional Leadership Fund and Caleb Crosby, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Chevron Corporation (Chevron) or its subsidiary Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (Chevron U.S.A.) made a prohibited contribution as a federal contractor and that the Congressional Leadership Fund and Crosby, in his official capacity as treasurer, (CLF) knowingly solicited a prohibited contribution from Chevron or Chevron U.S.A.&#160; <br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe that Chevron or Chevron U.S.A. made, or CLF solicited, a prohibited contribution because the available information indicates that (1) Chevron was the entity that made the contribution in question, (2) Chevron was not a federal contractor at the time it made the contribution, and (3) Chevron and Chevron U.S.A. appear to be separate and distinct legal entities.</p>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6757</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: FEC-Initiated<br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: Gillibrand for Senate and Karen Feldman, in her official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT:&#160; In the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities, the Commission initiated proceedings to determine whether there was reason to believe Gillibrand for Senate and Feldman, in her official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) failed to disclose accurately a total of $12,124.00 in receipts and $229,478.83 in disbursements in 10 disclosure reports filed during the 2010 and 2012 election cycles.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission entered into a conciliation agreement providing for the Committee to pay a civil penalty of $8,000.</p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><strong>ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>\n          <p><strong/></p>\n          <p>The Commission made public five campaign finance enforcement matters that were resolved through its Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) program, as follows.
