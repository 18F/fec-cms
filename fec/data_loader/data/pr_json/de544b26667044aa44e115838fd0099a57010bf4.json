Dale Shearer as Treasurer; Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and John B. Poersch, Jr., as Treasurer.

Bauerly, Caroline C. Hunter and Donald F. McGahn, II. A separate <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocs/29044242603.pdf\">Statement of Reasons</a> was issued by Vice Chairman Petersen and Commissioners Hunter and McGahn. </p>\n              <p><strong>LITIGATION</strong></p>\n              <p><strong><em><a href=\"../../law/litigation/rnc_08.shtml\">Republican National Committee v. FEC</a>.</em></strong><strong> </strong>On June 8, the Commission filed a <a href=\"../../law/litigation/rnc_fec_supp_reply_mot_dismiss.pdf\">Supplemental Reply Memorandum</a> with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in support of the FEC&#8217;s motion to dismiss the case. The Commission reiterated the argument that RNC Chairman Michael Steele&#8217;s claims are barred because they were already litigated in the <em>McConnell v. FEC</em> case and fail as a matter of law.</p>\n              <p>The complaint challenges the constitutionality of the <a href=\"../../pages/bcra/bcra_update.shtml\">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act&#8217;s</a> limits on the use of soft money (nonfederal funds) by political party committees. The Plaintiffs state that the soft money provisions as applied to their intended activities are overly broad and unconstitutional under the First Amendment guarantees of free speech and association, and are outside of Congress&#8217; authority to regulate elections. The Commission contends that the soft money provisions are constitutional contribution limits that prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption.</p>\n              <p><strong>AUDIT REPORTS</strong></p>\n              <p>The Commission approved and made public two Audit Reports. A summary of the findings is below. Final Audit Reports are available<strong> <a href=\"../../audits/audit_reports.shtml\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n              <p><a href=\"../../audits/2008/20090603_Kucinich_for_Pres_2008.pdf\">Kucinich for President 2008, Inc. </a>&#160;The audit, which was conducted under the FEC&#8217;s mandate to audit every committee that receives matching funds from the U.S. Treasury, revealed no issues requiring correction. </p>\n              <p><a href=\"../../audits/2006/20090522_Zinga_for_Congress.pdf\">Zinga for Congress</a>. The audit identified 16 excessive contributions from nine individuals, totaling $8,600. The report indicated that the Committee understated receipts and disbursements by $23,926 and $40,810, respectively, which caused an overstatement of its ending cash on hand balance. Other findings include the failure to report or adequately disclose the occupation and employer information concerning 148 individual contributions, the lack of purpose, payee, and date information on disbursements totaling $50,158, and failure to disclose or continuously report candidate loans and debts. In response, the Committee amended its reports to disclose the missing information.</p>\n              <p><strong>PRESS RELEASES</strong></p>\n              <p><a href=\"20090608PresStat.shtml\">2008 Presidential Campaign Financial Activity Summarized</a> (released June 8)</p>\n              <p><a href=\"20090610MUR.shtml\">FEC Takes Final Action on Six Cases</a> (released June 10) </p>\n              <p><strong>NEXT WEEK (JUNE 15 &#8211; 19, 2009)</strong></p>\n              <p>June 18:&#160; The Commission is scheduled to meet in <a href=\"../../agenda/agendas.shtml#open\">Open Session</a>. </p>\n              <p>June 20:&#160; Disclosure reports for monthly filers are due.&#160; Click <a href=\"../../elecfil/electron.shtml\">here</a> for information on electronic filing. </p>\n              <p><strong>UPCOMING REPORTING DUE DATES</strong></p>\n              <p>July 15 &#8211; July Quarterly Report</p>\n              <p>July 20 &#8211; July Monthly Report</p>\n              <p>July 31 &#8211; July Mid-Year Report</p>\n              <p><strong>UPCOMING EVENTS</strong></p>\n              <p>June 24-25, Tallahassee, FL &#8211; As part of its <a href=\"../../info/outreach.shtml#state\">State Outreach Program</a>, the FEC will conduct informal briefings for PACs, party committees and candidate committees on areas of the law specific to their needs.
