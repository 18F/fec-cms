But systems standards must be updated and implemented\n    to hasten the day when system-failures are news primarily because those problems and\n    failures are so rare.<span>&#160; </span>As the Chairman said,\n    this draft, and the comments received that will eventually compose Volume II, can go a\n    long way toward that goal.&#148; </p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">&#160;<p/></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">Comments on the draft standards must be\n    received no later than 60 days after the notice seeking comments has been published in the\n    <i>Federal Register</i>.<span>\n    &#160; </span>Copies of the proposed standards may be found on the FEC&#146;s website at <b><i><p/></i></b><a href=\"../pages/standardsoverview.htm\">http://www.fec.gov/pages/standardsoverview.htm</a>,\n    or may be requested by contacting the Office of Election Administration, 202-694-1095.<span>&#160; </span>All comments should be addressed to Ms. Penelope\n    Bonsall, Director, Office of Election Administration, Federal Election Commission, 999 E\n    Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20463 and must be submitted in either written or electronic\n    form.<span>&#160; </span>Electronic mail comments should be\n    sent to <b><i><a href=\"mailto:VSS@fec.gov\">VSS@fec.gov</a>.<p/></i></b></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><i>&#160;</i></b></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>#<span>&#160;&#160; </span>#<span>&#160;&#160; </span>#<i><p/></i></b></p></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</font></font></font></body>\n"}
