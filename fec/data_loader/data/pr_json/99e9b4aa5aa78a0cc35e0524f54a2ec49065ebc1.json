Six years ago, when the same Senate seats were up for election, candidates raised $166.7 million during the year before the mid-term elections. However, there are two additional open seats this election cycle due to the vacancies created by the Senate resignations of Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In addition, a Senate vacancy occurred in Massachusetts after Senator Edward Kennedy&#8217;s death.</p>\n        <p>Candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives raised $361.2 million in 2009, an increase of over 5% compared to 2007 levels.These campaigns spent $195.9 million, more than 5% over total expenditures in 2007.They entered the election year with cash-on-hand of $326.2 million, up 10% from the $296.6 million reported at the end of 2007. </p>\n        <p>Historical tables attached to this release show that receipts for House Democratic campaigns were $199.9 million in 2009, a decrease of less than 1% from their 2007 total.While Democratic House incumbents increased their fundraising total compared to 2007, Democratic House challengers and open seat candidates reported a decrease in the amount of contributions received compared to 2007.Republican House candidates raised $161 million in 2009, a 12.9% increase from 2007.Unlike Democratic House candidates, Republican House challengers and open seat candidates reported an increase in contributions in 2009, while incumbents reported a decrease in contributions compared to 2007.</p>\n        <p>The following chart compares non-election year financial activity (reported in millions of dollars) for all Senate and House campaigns during the last seven election cycles. These figures have not been adjusted for inflation.</p>\n        <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"images/chart.JPG\" width=\"534\" height=\"322\" alt=\"Chart\"/>   </p>\n        <p>Individual contributions remain the largest source of Congressional campaign revenues.The $363.9 million contributed by individuals in 2009 was almost 31% more than in 2007 and represented 61% of all fundraising during the year, up from 55% in 2007.The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) increased campaign contribution limits for individuals from $1,000 per election to $2,000 and indexed them for inflation.The limit for individual contributions in 2009-2010 is $2,400 per election, or a total of $4,800 for a primary and general election. </p>\n        <p>Although contribution limits to Congressional campaigns from political action committees (PACs) and other candidate committees were left largely unchanged under BCRA, contributions from these entities increased by 1.5% to $159.8 million in 2009.Contributions and loans made by candidates to their own campaigns totaled $51.5 million or 8.6% of all funds raised, an increase of $23.4 million from 2007.</p>\n        <p>The attached tables display receipts of Congressional campaigns in the 2010 cycle and include comparisons for the past eight election cycles.Also provided are financial totals for specific Senate candidates from 2003 to 2009 and House candidates for 2009. </p>\n        <p>Please note that receipts include contributions, transfers from other committees, loans, refunds from vendors, interest income and other revenue.</p>\n        <p><strong>Tables</strong> </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Off-Year Activity of 2010 Congressional Campaigns [<a
