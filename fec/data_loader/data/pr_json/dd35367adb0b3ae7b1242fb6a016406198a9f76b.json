From\nJanuary 1, 1995, through December 31, 1996,  PACs raised $437.4\nmillion, an increase of 12% over 1994, and spent $429.9 million,\nup 11% over 1994.  Cash on hand as of December 31, 1996, totalled\n$103.9 million.\n</p><p>\n PACs  contributed $217.8 million to federal candidates during\nthe 1995-96 cycle, up $28.5 million (15%) when compared to the\nprevious two-year cycle.  Most of the money, $203.9 million, went\nto candidates seeking election in 1995-96.  The remaining $13.9\nmillion went to candidates running for office in future years,\nor to debt retirement for candidates in past cycles.  Incumbents\nreceived $146.4 million, challengers were given $31.6 million,\nand open seat candidates $39.8 million.  This represents a lower\nproportion of contributions to incumbents than has been common\nin recent election cycles.\n</p><p>\n  The following table shows the distribution of contributions\nto incumbents, challengers, and open seat races over six election\ncycles (in millions of dollars).\n</p><p>\n      <b>AMOUNT &amp; PERCENTAGE OF PAC CONTRIBUTIONS ACCORDING\nTO CANDIDATE STATUS</b>\n</p><hr/>\n\n<pre width=\"132\">\n                                                                                          \n\n             <b>1995-96</b>     <b>1993-94</b>      <b>1991-92</b>        <b>1989-90</b>        <b>1987-88</b>      <b>1985-86</b>             \n\n<b>Incumbents</b>  $146.4 67%   $137.2  72%   $135.3 72%   $125.8  79%   $118.2 74%   $96.2  69%  \n          <b/>                                                                                 \n\n<b>Challengers</b> $31.6  15%   $19.0   10%   $22.9  12%   $16.2   10%   $18.9  12%   $19.9  14%  \n                                                                                     \n\n      <b>Open</b>  $39.8  18%   $33.4   18%   $30.7  16%   $17.1   11%   $22.2  14%   $23.8  17%  \n     <b>Seats</b>                                                                                 \n\n\n</pre>\n<hr/>\n\n<p>\n  For the first time in recent years, Republican candidates received\nmore PAC contributions than their Democratic counterparts.
