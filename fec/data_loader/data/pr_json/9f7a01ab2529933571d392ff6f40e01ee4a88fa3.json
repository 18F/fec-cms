The rules themselves were passed by the FEC on June 22, 2002,\n    meeting a 90-day deadline for rulemaking included in the statute.</p>\n    <p>Voting in the affirmative for the E&amp;J were Chairman David M. Mason, Vice Chairman\n    Karl J. Sandstrom, Commissioner Bradley A. Smith, and Commissioner Michael E. Toner.\n    Objecting for the record were Commissioner Danny L. McDonald and Commissioner Scott E.\n    Thomas. </p>\n    <p>The Explanation and Justification, along with the final rules, are available from the\n    FEC&#146;s web site at <a href=\"http://sers.fec.gov/fosers/\">http://www.fec.gov/register.htm</a>, and\n    a limited number of hard copies are available from the FEC Press Office. The E&amp;J and\n    final rules will be transmitted this week to Congress, and to the Federal Register for\n    publication.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"100%\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "date": "07/16/2002", "href": "press2002/20020716advisory.html", "category": "Rulemakings", "title": "FEC Approves Soft Money Explanation and Justification Rules", "pdf": null}
