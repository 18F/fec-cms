TRINLER, TREAS?</p>\n    <p>MARGARET H. KANNENSOHN?DEM</p>\n    \n    <p/>\n    <p>The report was due April 15, 2004 and should have included financial \n    activity for the period January 1, 2004 through March 31, 2004. If sent by \n    certified or registered mail, the reports should have been postmarked by \n    April 15, 2004. Mandatory electronic filing requirements became effective as \n    of January 1, 2001. Any committee that receives contributions or makes \n    expenditures in excess of $50,000 in the current calendar year, or that \n    reasonably expects to do so, must submit its reports electronically. These \n    rules became effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January \n    1, 2001.</p>\n    <p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports \n    under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state \n    ballots. If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is \n    not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n    <p>The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential \n    filing requirements on March 22, 2004. Those committees which did not file \n    on the due date were notified on<b> </b>April 22, 2004 that reports had not \n    been received and that their names would be published if they did not \n    respond within four business days.</p>\n    <p>Other political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in \n    elections (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) \n    also are required to file pre&#8209;primary reports, unless they report monthly. \n    Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n    <p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided \n    on a case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to \n    initiate enforcement actions and the FEC has implemented a new \n    administrative fine program which will subject committees to penalties \n    ranging from $30 to $16,000 or more.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></th>\n  </tr>\n  </table>\n</body>\n", "date": "04/29/2004", "href": "press2004/20040429fail.html", "category": "Non-Filer Publications", "title": "Campaign Fails to File April Quarterly Report", "pdf": null}
