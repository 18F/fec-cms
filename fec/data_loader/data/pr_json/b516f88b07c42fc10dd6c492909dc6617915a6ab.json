The draft proposed rules would update 11 CFR part 7 to reflect statutory changes enacted after the Standards of Conduct originally were promulgated, and to conform to regulations issued by the Office of Government Ethics and Office of Personnel Management. The draft rules also would supplement, for Commissioners and employees of the Commission, the Office of Government Ethics Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch.</p>\n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"100%\" valign=\"top\"><p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
