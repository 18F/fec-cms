Thomas, noting that the President has made full funding of the\nFederal Election Commission&#146;s budget request a priority in previous years, said in a\ncover letter to OMB and members of Congress, \"We believe that continuing these\nefforts to provide the Commission with sufficient resources will be vital during this\nelection cycle, for which all indicators point to a new record level of spending in\nfederal campaigns. We anticipate that highly competitive congressional elections, and an\nopen presidential nomination election for both major parties, will result in even higher\nworkloads for the FEC.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Executive Summary of the submitted budget request points out that a funding level\nof $41.3 million for FY2001 will enable the Commission to:</p>\n\n<p>-- Continue its progress on implementation of the PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) audit\nrecommendations.</p>\n\n<p>-- Complete the 2000 Presidential audits within two years of the election.</p>\n\n<p>-- Conduct 40 to 45 \"for cause\" audits as opposed to the 20 to 25 in the\nprevious election cycles.</p>\n\n<p>-- Maintain a timely and enhanced campaign finance disclosure program.</p>\n\n<p>-- Ensure that significant efforts are made to enforce the disclosure and limitation\nprovisions of the FECA.</p>\n\n<p>-- Complete the revision of the Voting Systems Standards and conduct a national\nconference of elections officials to introduce the new standards.</p>\n\n<p>-- Develop and maintain enhanced computer capabilities, including the implementation of\na mandatory electronic filing program; conversion to a client server environment;\nexpansion of the FEC&#146;s Web site; reengineering the disclosure imaging system; the\nimplementation of the state filing waiver initiative; development of a Commission-wide\ndocument management system; and operation of a case management system.</p>\n\n<p>FEC Chairman Thomas&#146; letter concludes, \"The Commission strongly urges the\nfull support of our FY2001 budget request which will enable the Commission to perform its\nstatutory mission and meet its program goals and objectives.\"</p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\">&#160;</p>\n\n<p>*The Treasury-Postal FY2000 appropriations bill provided $38,152,000 for the FEC, which\nwas supplemented by a carryover of $270,000 in FY1999 funds. But an across-the-board\ngovernment rescission of .38% in the Consolidated Appropriations Act -- signed by the\nPresident on November 29 -- trimmed the FEC appropriation by $144,000, establishing the\ntotal FY2000 budget for the FEC at $38,278,000. </p>\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n</font>\n</body>\n", "href": "budg01.htm", "date": "12/09/1999", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Submits 2001 Budget Request", "category": "Other Agency Actions"}
