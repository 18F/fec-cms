Of this amount, individuals accounted for $58.6 million, with PAC contributions accounting for $9.2 million. The 43 Republican candidates raised $52.9 million. Of this amount, individuals contributed $37.2 million and PACs contributed $11.7 million.</p>\n      <p>While comparisons of Senate races across election cycles are problematic because of the different states involved, variations in the timing of members decisions to retire, and other unique circumstances in each cycle, during the first nine months of 2005 incumbent candidates currently running in 2006 raised $90.4 million, while in 2004 incumbents raised $65.6 million during the first nine months of 2003.&#160; </p>\n      <p>Democratic challengers raised $11.6 million thus far in 2005, compared to $3.9 million through September 2003.&#160; (There are two more Republican members running for reelection in 2005.) For the same period, Republican challengers raised $8.5 million in 2005 compared to $4.5 million in 2003.&#160; (There were 14 Democratic members seeking reelection in both cycles.) Candidates running for open seats reported raising $39.1 million for the first nine months of 2003 and only $16 million in 2005. (There was substantial early fundraising in 2003 in the open seat in Illinois, and there were almost twice as many candidates in open seat races during the nine month period in 2003 than in 2005.)</p>\n      <p>Candidates ended the first nine months of 2005 with $132 million cash-on-hand.</p>\n      <p>The attached pages provide summary statistical information on each candidate.&#160; Financial activity for 2001-02 and 2003-04 is also included where available.&#160; The next reports for Senate campaigns are due January 31, 2006 and cover October 1 &#8211; December 31, 2005.&#160; &#160;</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p>The following tables in EXCEL format can be read using Excel from <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft</a> or Adobe Reader from <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/\">Adobe</a>.</p>\n    <p>Senate  Summary [<a href=\"sen9monthoverview.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"sen9monthoverview.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>Six Year Financial Activity for 2006 Senate Campaigns [<a href=\"sen62005Q3.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"sen62005Q3.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>Senate Incumbent Top 50 Receipts [<a href=\"sen50rec.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"sen50rec.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>Senate Incumbent Top 50 Contributions from Individuals [<a href=\"sen50indiv.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"sen50indiv.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>Senate Incumbent Top 50 Contributions from Other Committees (PACs) [<a href=\"sen50pac.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"sen50pac.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>Senate Incumbent Top 50 Cash on Hand [<a href=\"sen50cash.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"sen50cash.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>&#160;</p>\n    <p align=\"center\">###</p></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</body>\n"}
