This release summarizes data contained in those reports. </p>\n              <p>National committees of the major parties are required to submit financial reports on a monthly basis. As a result, it is now possible to compare their activity over a 13-month period from January 1, 2007, through January 31, 2008. The three national committees of the Democratic party&#8212;the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) &#8212;reported raising a total of $191.3 million in the first 13 months of the 2008 election cycle. This represents an increase of 26% over a similar period in 2006, and 85% over the first 13 months of the 2004 election cycle. The three Republican national party committees&#8212;the Republican National Committee (RNC), the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) &#8212;reported raising $186.2 million during the same period.&#160; This represents a decrease of 18% from 2006 and 2004 totals.</p>\n              <p>The DSCC and DCCC reported substantial gains, while total receipts declined slightly for the DNC.&#160; The strongest growth came from the DCCC, whose $71.5 million in receipts through January 31, 2008, represented a 57% increase over 2006 levels. &#160;This total was $18 million more than the NRCC raised during the same period.</p>\n              <p>All of the Republican party&#8217;s national committees reported revenue declines.&#160; The RNC raised $97.5 million, down 18% from 2006.&#160; The $35.4 million raised by the NRSC represented a decline of 11%, while the NRCC raised $53.3 million, down 22% from 2006.</p>\n              <p>Additional information for party committees at the state and local level is available through the end of 2007.* &#160;&#160;Democratic party committees at all levels reported significant increases in receipts during 2007, while overall Republican party receipts declined from 2005. &#160;</p>\n              <p>Democratic committees at the federal, state and local levels reported raising $211.3 million in federal funds during 2007&#8212;23% more than the $172.4 million they raised in 2005 (See Table 2, attached). </p>\n              <p>Republican committees at the federal, state and local levels raised $208.4 million in federal funds in 2007, down 16% from the $248.6 million these committees raised in 2005 (see Table 3).&#160; </p>\n              <p>The following chart summarizes financial activity for all national parties in non-election years since 1999. Note that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) eliminated all non-federal, or &#8220;soft money,&#8221; fundraising (such as contributions from corporations or unions or unlimited contributions from individuals) by national party committees.&#160; All national party receipts now must comply with federal limits and prohibitions.&#160; Such funds are often referred to as &#8220;hard money.&#8221;</p>\n              <p/>\n              <table width=\"658\" height=\"92\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n                <tr valign=\"top\">\n                  <td rowspan=\"2\" nowrap=\"nowrap\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"><p/>                    <p/></td>\n                  <td colspan=\"2\"><p align=\"center\"/>                    <p align=\"center\">1999</p></td>\n                  <td colspan=\"2\"><p align=\"center\">2001</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">2003</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"67\"><p align=\"center\">2005</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"75\"><p align=\"center\">2007</p></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">Non-Federal Receipts</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">Non-Federal Receipts</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"67\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"75\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr valign=\"top\">\n                  <td width=\"101\"><p>Democrats</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">$54.4</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">$55.4</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">$68.6</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">$59.7</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">$95.2</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"67\"><p align=\"center\">$142.6</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"75\"><p align=\"center\">$177.7</p></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr valign=\"top\">\n                  <td width=\"101\"><p>Republicans</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">$59.6</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">$95.3</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">$100.1</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">$133.9</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"79\"><p align=\"center\">$206.9</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"67\"><p align=\"center\">$205.9</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"75\"><p align=\"center\">$167.1</p></td>\n                </tr>\n              </table>\n              <p/>\n              <p align=\"center\">Millions of dollars</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>State and local party fundraising is not included in this table.</p>\n              <p>Tables attached to this release provide details of financial activity in non-election years since 1991.</p>\n              <p>Individuals are by far the largest source of federal funds for party committees.&#160; Republican committees reported receiving $176.7 million from individuals (85% of their receipts) in 2007, while Democrats received $161.2 million (76% of their total). </p>\n              <p>BCRA changed contribution limits, increasing the limit for individuals giving to national parties to $25,000, adjusted for inflation.&#160; The inflation-adjusted limit for the 2007-2008 election cycle is $28,500. Table 4 breaks down those contributions by size in recent non-election years.&#160; The table shows that all national committees, except the DSCC, continue to receive more dollars from donations in amounts less than $200 than from contributions in any other category. </p>\n              <p>Political Action Committees (PACs) and other committees contributed $22 million to Republican party committees and $36.2 million to Democratic party committees in 2007-2008.&#160; Much of this total comes from House Democrats who contributed $17.7 million from their campaign accounts to the DCCC during 2007 (and $18.4 million through January 2008). &#160;Table 5 provides a list of Members and their contributions to the DCCC. House Republicans contributed $10 million to the NRCC in 2007 and $10.6 million through January 2008.&#160; These contributions are detailed in Table 6.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>* State and local party committees are permitted to file reports on a quarterly basis, so the most current information for them covers only calendar 2007.</p>\n              <p>&#160;</p>\n              <p>Table 1 National Party Financial Activity Through January 31, 2008  [<a href=\"nationaljan.xls\">excel</a>] [<a href=\"nationaljan.pdf\">pdf</a>] </p>\n              <p>Table 2 Democratic Party Committee Financial Activity Through December 31, 2007 [<a href=\"demptyoff2007.xls\">excel</a>] [<a href=\"demptyoff2007.pdf\">pdf</a>] </p>\n              <p>Table 3 Republican Party Committee Financial Activity Through December 31, 2007 <a href=\"repptyoff2007.xls\">[excel</a>] [<a href=\"repptyoff2007.pdf\">pdf]</a></p>\n              <p>Table 4 Contributions from Individuals to National Party Committees by Contribution Amount <a href=\"ptyindoff.xls\">[excel</a>] [<a href=\"ptyindoff.pdf\">pdf]</a></p>\n              <p>Table 5 Member Contributions to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href=\"DCCCmembers2007.xls\">[excel</a>] [<a href=\"DCCCmembers2007.pdf\">pdf]</a></p>\n              <p>Table 6 Member Contributions to the National Republican Congressional Committee <a href=\"nrccmembers2007.xls\">[excel</a>] [<a href=\"nrccmembers2007.pdf\">pdf]</a></p>\n              <p>&#160;</p>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
