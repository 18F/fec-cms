District Court a joint motion for a stay in implementing the recent District Court\n    decision McConnell v. FEC, pending a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.<p>FEC Chair Ellen\n    L. Weintraub issued the following statement: </p>\n    <p>\"The regulated community has had to adapt to widespread changes in the regulatory\n    regime as a result of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, and further adjustments may be\n    required after the Supreme Court rules.</p>\n    <p>\"To expect people to assimilate and operate under three separate sets of rules\n    within a single election cycle is unreasonable, unrealistic, and invites error. Stability\n    and clarity will be served by a stay of the District Court decision, pending a ruling by\n    the Supreme Court.\"</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "20030509advisory.html", "date": "05/09/2003", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Files Motion for a Stay in District Court Decision in ", "category": "McConnell v.
