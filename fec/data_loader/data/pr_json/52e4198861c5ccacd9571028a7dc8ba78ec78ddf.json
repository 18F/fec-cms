This brings to 95 the total \n    number of cases released thus far. The program&#146;s goal is to expedite \n    resolution of some enforcement matters, reduce the cost of processing \n    complaints, and enhance overall FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated \n    settlement summaries are available in the FEC&#146;s Press and Public Records \n    offices.</span></p>\n    <p align=\"left\"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; \n    For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent must express \n    willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of \n    limitations while the case is pending in the ADR Office, and agree to \n    participate in bilateral negotiations and, if necessary, mediation.</span></p>\n    <p align=\"left\"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; \n    Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching an expedient \n    resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both satisfying to \n    the respondent(s) and in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). \n    Resolutions reached through direct and, when necessary, mediated \n    negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval. If a \n    resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds by \n    mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved \n    through ADR are not precedential.</span></p>\n    <p align=\"RIGHT\"/>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"9\" width=\"736\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\"><b>1.</b></td>\n        <td width=\"29%\"><b>ADR 120</b></td>\n        <td width=\"65%\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\"><b>RESPONDENTS:</b></td>\n        <td width=\"65%\">Friends of Dave Rogers, Christian Winthrop, treasurer<p>\n        David Rogers</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\"><b>SOURCE:</b></td>\n        <td width=\"65%\">MUR 5326: William J.
