If sent by certified or registered mail, the reports \n    should have been postmarked by October 25. Otherwise, the due date was \n    close&#8209;of&#8209;business October 28. Mandatory electronic filing requirements \n    became effective as of January 1, 2001. Any committee that receives \n    contributions or makes expenditures in excess of $50,000 in the current \n    calendar year, or that reasonably expects to do so, must submit its reports \n    electronically. While this committee's report was filed on paper by \n    registered/certified mail on October 24, it is required to file its reports \n    electronically.These rules became effective for reporting periods beginning \n    on or after January 1, 2001.</span></p>\n    <p align=\"left\"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; \n    Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports \n    under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state \n    ballots. If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is \n    not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</span></p>\n    <p align=\"left\"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; \n    The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential \n    filing requirements on October 3. Those committees which did not file on the \n    due date were notified on October 29 that reports had not been received and \n    that their names would be published if they did not respond within four \n    business days.</span></p>\n    <p align=\"left\"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; \n    Other political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in \n    elections (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) \n    also are required to file pre&#8209;primary reports, unless they report monthly. \n    Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</span></p>\n    <p align=\"left\"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; \n    Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a \n    case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate \n    enforcement actions and the FEC has implemented a new administrative fine \n    program which will subject committees to penalties ranging from $30 to \n    $16,000 or more.</span></p>\n    <p align=\"left\"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; \n    The next regular scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees will \n    be the Year End report, due 1/31/04.
