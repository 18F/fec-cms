This brings to 209 \n        the total number of cases released since the ADR program began October \n        2, 2000. The program's goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement \n        matters, reduce the cost of processing complaints, and enhance overall \n        FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available \n        in the FEC's Press and Public Records offices. </span></p>\n      <p align=\"left\"> <span>For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent \n        must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside \n        the statute of limitations while the case is pending in the ADR Office, \n        and agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if necessary, \n        mediation.</span></p>\n      <p align=\"left\"><span>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching \n        an expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both \n        satisfying to the respondent(s) and in compliance with the Federal Election \n        Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions reached through direct and, when necessary, \n        mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval. \n        If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds \n        by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved \n        through ADR are not precedential.</span></p></td></tr>\n        <tr><td colspan=\"3\">\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"8%\" valign=\"top\"><b>1/2.</b></td>\n          <td width=\"22%\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>ADRs <a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=223&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">223</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=256&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">256</a>  </strong></p>\n          </td>\n          <td width=\"70%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"8%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"22%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"70%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"8%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"22%\" valign=\"top\"><b>RESPONDENTS:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"70%\" valign=\"top\"><p> National Italian American PAC, Anthony N.

The Committee , on learning of the reporting violations and prohibited contributions/loans, initiated actions to correct the errors and pay the loans and refund the excessive contributions. Respondents, in an effort to avoid similar errors in the future agree to employ an election law compliance officer within 30 days of the effective date of this agreement; send the Treasurer and compliance officer to a FEC seminar appropriate for PACs within 12 months of the effective date of this agreement; work with a RAD analyst to ensure that all required reports are filed within 90 days of the effective date of this agreement and pay a civil penalty. The Commission and Respondents determined that an appropriate civil penalty to resolve these matters was $35,000. However, due to the terms and conditions Respondents consent to , the Commission agrees to depart substantially from the civil penalty that the Commission has determined is justified to resolve these matters. Respondents will pay $10,000 of the civil penalty within 60 days of the effective date of this agreement. In the event that the terms of this agreement are violated, or the Respondents fail to comply with the requirements of the FECA during the 24 months following the effective date of this agreement, the unpaid balance of the civil penalty of $35,000 shall be due immediately to the Commission. </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong> </td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at http://www.fec.gov by entering  223 and 256 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FECs Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>3.</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=237&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>ADR 237 </strong></a></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><b>RESPONDENTS:</b></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> Rick for Congress (FL/05), Doreen Penberthy, treasurer  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><b>SOURCE:</b></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> MUR 5521: Steven G.
