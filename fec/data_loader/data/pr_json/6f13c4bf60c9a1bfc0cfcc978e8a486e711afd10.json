Herrera, TREAS&#135;John \n      Kelley&#135;REP</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>The reports were to include financial activity occurring from January 1 \n    through February 18. If sent by certified or registered mail, the reports \n    should have been postmarked by February 23. Otherwise, the due date was \n    close-of-business February 26. Mandatory electronic filing requirements \n    became effective as of January 1, 2001. Any committee that receives \n    contributions or makes expenditures in excess of $50,000 in the current \n    calendar year, or that reasonably expects to do so, must submit its reports \n    electronically. These rules became effective for reporting periods beginning \n    on or after January 1, 2001.</p>\n    <p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports \n    under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state \n    ballots. If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is \n    not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n    <p>The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential \n    filing requirements on February 2. Those committees which did not file on \n    the due date were notified on February 27 that reports had not been received \n    and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four \n    business days.</p>\n    <p>Other political committees supporting House candidates in elections \n    (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are \n    required to file pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly. Those \n    committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n    <p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers falls under \n    the Administrative Fine Program. Political committees and treasurers who \n    fail to file their reports on time may be subject to civil money penalties \n    ranging from $30 to $16,000 (or more for repeat late- and non-filers).</p>\n    <p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees \n    will be the quarterly report, due April 15. It will cover activity from \n    February 19 through March 31.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  </table>\n</body>\n"}
