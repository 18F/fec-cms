Other requirements to \n    be declared eligible include agreeing to an overall spending limit, abiding \n    by spending limits in each state, using public funds only for legitimate \n    campaign related expenses, keeping financial records and permitting an \n    extensive campaign audit. </p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Based on documents filed by the Lieberman campaign on \n    October 22, 2003, contributions from the following states were verified for \n    threshold purposes: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of \n    Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, \n    Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, \n    Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Once declared eligible, campaigns may submit additional \n    contributions for matching funds on the first business day of every month. \n    The U.S. Treasury Department will pay the FEC certified amounts beginning in \n    January 2004. The maximum amount a candidate could receive is currently \n    estimated to be $18.6 million.</p>\n    <p align=\"center\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "20031114matching.html", "date": "11/14/2003", "pdf": null, "title": "Lieberman Third Presidential Candidate Declared Eligible for Primary Matching Funds in 2004 Race", "category": "Presidential Public Funds"}
