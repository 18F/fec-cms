Non-connected PACs (those which are not connected to or sponsored by a\n    corporation or labor organization, and which are not related to a candidate's campaign or\n    to a political party organization) must register within 10 days after certain financial\n    activity exceeds $1,000 during a calendar year. </p>\n    <p>Registration does not necessarily imply financial activity. Many PACs report making no\n    contributions to candidates or independent expenditures on behalf of or against\n    candidates. Financial information on PACs will be included in future FEC news releases.</p>\n    <p>The following chart details the number of PACs in existence since the end of 1974.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\">&#160;</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"082101pacchart.html\">-more-</a></p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\">&#160;</p>\n    <font size=\"1\"><p>Footnotes for Chart:<b/></p>\n    <p>*For 1974-76, these numbers represent all other PACs...no further categorization is\n    available.</p>\n    <sup><b/><p>1 On November 24, 1975, the Commission issued Advisory Opinion 1975-23\n    \"SUNPAC\".</p>\n    <b/><p>2 On May 11, 1976, Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1976 (P.L.\n    94-283) were enacted.</p>\n    <p>3 During the first six months of 1997, 227 PACs were administratively terminated\n    because of inactivity.</p></sup></font></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"100%\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n"}
