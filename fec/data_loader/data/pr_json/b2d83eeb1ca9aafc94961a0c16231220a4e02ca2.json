The Federal Election Commission (FEC/the Commission) recently entered into a conciliation agreement with Mr. Jamie Jacob Morgan (Morgan), a 2002 Republican candidate for Congress in Michigan&#8217;s 12th District.&#160; Morgan agreed to pay a $60,000 civil penalty for committing knowing and willful violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act).</p>\n              <p>The complaint centered on inflated and fictitious contributions and refunds reported by Morgan for Congress (the Committee) in several original and amended submissions of FEC disclosure reports in 2002.&#160; The Act requires every political committee to have a treasurer who files periodic reports with the FEC disclosing the committee&#8217;s receipts and disbursements.&#160; The treasurer, and any other person required to file any report or statement under the Act, is personally responsible for the accuracy of the information contained in it.&#160; Morgan himself acted as the <em>de facto </em>treasurer of the Committee and prepared and filed all of the reports with the Commission, rather than the Committee&#8217;s treasurer.&#160; Morgan initially alleged that the inaccuracies stemmed from computer problems, but he later accepted responsibility for his actions.&#160; After an investigation, the Commission found reason to believe that Morgan knowingly and willingly failed to file accurate disclosure reports, accepted excessive contributions and contributions in the name of another, commingled campaign funds with his personal funds, and that he failed to keep and maintain proper records in 2002.&#160; </p>\n              <p>The Act specifically addresses violations of the law that are knowing and willful.&#160; The phrase &#8220;knowing and willful&#8221; indicates that violations were committed with knowledge and recognition that one is violating the law.&#160; The Commission determined that Jamie Jacob Morgan acted deliberately and with knowledge that contributions and refunds reported in 2002 reports were false, that contributions he received exceed the contribution limits of the Act and were not his personal funds, and that he commingled campaign funds with his personal fund to unlawfully terminate the Committee.&#160; No further action was taken against the candidate&#8217;s brother, John Morgan, because he served as treasurer in name only and never fulfilled any duties or obligations as treasurer.&#160; </p>\n              <p>This release contains only disposition information.</p>\n              <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Matter&#160;
