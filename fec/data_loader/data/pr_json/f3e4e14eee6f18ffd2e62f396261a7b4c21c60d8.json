The Commission found that Mr. Shehan made excessive contributions to the Committee totaling $2,000 in the names of his minor children and he agreed to pay a civil penalty. The Commission dismissed this matter with regard to his daughters Georgia and Susan Shehan. The Commission found that the Committee failed to properly report correct contributor information for Georgia Shehan and the committee agreed to pay a civil penalty.&#160; </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\"><p>Documents from these matters are available from the \n              Commission's web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering \n              5335R under case number.

The response from CDC Racing believed it had not violated any federal election laws&#160; because it &#8220;did not give anything away.&#8221; The Commission found reason to believe that CDC violated the law by placing the &#8220;Bush-Cheney &#8217;04 logo on the car but used its prosecutorial discretion to take no further action because CDC is essentially defunt and the impact of the expenditure was limited. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td><p>Documents from these matters are available from the Commission's web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering 5420 under case number.
