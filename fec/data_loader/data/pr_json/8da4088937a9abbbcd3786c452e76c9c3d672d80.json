The Commission \n              found that the Committee had failed to file an amended Statement \n              of Organization when it changed treasurers. The Commission also \n              found the Committee failed to list the specific loan incurrence \n              dates in Schedule C of its Quarterly Report. The Commission found \n              there was no reason to believe that the committee was required to \n              file reports electronically, as it appeared that they did not meet \n              the threshold for electronic filing. The Commission found there \n              was no reason to believe the candidate used funds other than his \n              own to make loans to the committee.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"2%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"28%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"70%\">Documents from this matter are available from the Commission?s \n            web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering 5276 under \n            case number.
