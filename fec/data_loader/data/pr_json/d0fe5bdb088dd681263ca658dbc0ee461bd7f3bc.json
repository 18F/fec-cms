INGRAHAM, TREAS...JOHN W.\nLAWSON...DEM</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>The report was due July 15, 2000, and should have included financial activity for the\nperiod April 1, 2000, or from the inception of the committee, through June 30, 2000. If\nsent by certified or registered mail, the report should have been postmarked by midnight\nApril 15.</p>\n\n<p>Committees were notified of their filing requirements on <b>June 21</b>. Those\ncommittees which did not file on the due date were notified on July 21 that reports had\nnot been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within\nfour business days.</p>\n\n<p><u>For this publication, the Commission has focused attention only on those campaigns\nwith primaries during the third quarter of 2000</u>. The Commission publishes only the\nnames of those committees which have been designated by candidates as their principal\ncampaign committees.</p>\n\n<p>Other political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those\nwhich are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to file\nquarterly reports, unless they report monthly. Those committees are not published by the\nFEC.</p>\n\n<p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a\ncase-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement\nactions, including the imposition of civil penalties ($5,500 for \"any violation\"\nand $11,000 for any \"knowing and willful\" violation.)</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></font>\n</body>\n", "href": "073100nonfiler.htm", "date": "07/31/2000", "pdf": null, "title": "Six Campaigns Fail to File July Quarterly Report", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
