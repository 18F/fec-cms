Nonconnected PACs\n(those which are not connected to or sponsored by a corporation\nor labor organization, and which are not related to a candidate's\ncampaign or to a political party organization) must register within\n10 days after certain financial activity exceeds $1,000 during\na calendar year. \n</p><p>\nRegistration does not necessarily imply financial activity.  Many\nPACs report making no contributions to candidates or independent\nexpenditures on behalf of or against candidates.  Financial information\non PACs will be included in future FEC news releases.\n</p><p>\nThe following chart details the<a href=\"/press/paccount.htm\"> number of PACs in existence since\nthe end of 1974</a>.\n</p><p>\n\n\n\n</p></body>"}
