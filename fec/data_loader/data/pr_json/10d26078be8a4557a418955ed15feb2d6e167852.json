Adrian Plesha will pay a $60,000 civil penalty and Charles Ball for \n    Congress will pay $24,000.\n    <p>Shortly before the 1998 general election, Ball for Congress, acting \n    through its campaign manager Adrian Plesha, covertly arranged and financed \n    the dissemination of approximately 40,000 letters and 10,000 phone calls \n    that urged registered Democrats not to vote for Representative Ellen \n    Tauscher. The letters and phone calls came from the \"East Bay Democratic \n    Committee,\" a fictitious organization created by Adrian Plesha and Ball for \n    Congress. The letters contained a false address and falsely used neighboring \n    Democratic Congressman George Miller's name as the signatory. Plesha \n    knowingly made false statements to the FEC, denying involvement in or \n    knowledge of this scheme when in fact he had created, authorized and \n    distributed the fabricated letters and calls. To avoid being identified as \n    the true sponsor of the communications, Ball for Congress and Adrian Plesha \n    omitted the required disclaimers, created phony invoices, used stamps rather \n    than the committee&#146;s postal meter and asked vendors to hide any links \n    between the communications and Ball for Congress.</p>\n    <p>The Act prohibits Federal candidates or their agents from fraudulently \n    misrepresenting any committee under their control as speaking or writing on \n    behalf of any other candidate or political party on a matter that is \n    damaging to that other candidate or party. Additionally, the law requires \n    any person who expressly advocates the election or defeat of a federal \n    candidate through a mass mailing to include a disclaimer stating who paid \n    for and authorized the mailing.</p>\n    <p>The FEC also referred Mr. Plesha to the Department of Justice for \n    criminal prosecution. Mr. Plesha pled guilty to making false statements to \n    the FEC and was sentenced to three years of probation, a $5,000 fine and 160 \n    hours of community service.</p>\n    <p>&#160;</p>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">1.</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\"><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=4919&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR \n            4919</a></td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">RESPONDENTS:</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">(a) Charles Ball for Congress, Justin Briggs, \n        treasurer\n        <p>(b) Adrian Plesha \n        </p><p>(c) Heather Patterson</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">COMPLAINANT:</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">Internal</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">SUBJECT:</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">Fraudulent misrepresentation of campaign \n        authority; disclaimers</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">DISPOSITION:</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">(a) Conciliation Agreement: $24,000 civil \n        penalty<p>(b) Conciliation Agreement: $60,000 civil penalty</p><p>(c) RTB No \n        Further Action</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">Documents from this matter are available \n        from the Commission&#146;s web site at <a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs\">http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs</a> by \n        entering 4919 under case number.
