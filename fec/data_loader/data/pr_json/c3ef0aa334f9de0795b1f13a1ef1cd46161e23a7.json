They also require the Commission\nto audit publicly financed campaigns and seek repayment where appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>On December 12, 1998, the Commission approved on a 6-0 vote a Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking (NPR) that would address many of the sections in the current regulations,\nincluding:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Coordination between publicly funded Presidential candidates and their political\n      parties;</p>\n      <p>\"bright line\" distinction between primary and general election expenses;</p>\n      <p>winding down costs</p>\n      <p>compliance and fundraising costs;</p>\n      <p>modifying the audit and repayment processes;</p>\n      <p>statutory authority to order repayments of matching funds based on violations of the\n      primary spending limits;</p>\n      <p>capital assets;</p>\n      <p>transportation and services provided to the media;</p>\n      <p>matching-fund and disbursement documentation;</p>\n      <p>pre-nomination Vice Presidential committees;</p>\n      <p>nominating conventions and host committees.</p>\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Complete text within these topics and others in the proposed rulemaking was published\nin the <a href=\"pubfund.pdf\">Federal Register on December 16,\n1998</a>. </p>\n\n<p><b>No final decisions have been reached by the Commission on any of the proposed\nrevisions in the proposed rulemaking.</b></p>\n\n\n<p>Comments should be addressed to Ms. Susan E.
