For example, in 2004 there are Senate campaigns in several \n        large states that typically are more expensive. California , New York \n        , and Pennsylvania have incumbents seeking reelection, and there are open \n        seat races in Florida and Illinois . </p>\n      <p>House campaigns raised $460.8 million (up 14.5% from 2002 levels) and \n        spent $278.1 million (12.2% above previous cycle totals). They reported \n        a cash balance of $300.4 million as of June 30. Receipts by Republican \n        candidates increased 28% with large increases for challengers and incumbent \n        candidates and a decline in overall receipts for open seats. Democratic \n        candidates' receipts were 1% higher than in the last cycle with increases \n        for incumbent and challenger candidates offset by a large decline for \n        open seats. Both the number of open seat candidates and their financial \n        activity declined in 2004 with the smallest number of open seat campaigns \n        since 1990. Tables and charts that follow, however, show that median receipts \n        grew in 2004 for all types of House campaigns except Democratic challengers \n        where median receipts fell 17% to just under $30,000. </p>\n      <p>Contributions from individuals totaled $484.9 million and continue to \n        be the largest source of receipts for Congressional candidates, representing \n        60.7% of all fundraising as of June 30. PAC contributions totaled $188 \n        million or 23.5% while candidates themselves contributed or loaned a total \n        of $97 million which was 12% of all receipts. Contributions from individuals \n        grew by 37% when compared with the same time period in the 2002 campaign, \n        while PAC contributions increased by 11% and contributions and loans from \n        candidates themselves were 81% greater than 2002 totals. </p>\n      <p>Tables attached to this release offer summary data for Senate and House \n        candidates by political party, as well as by candidate status (incumbent, \n        challenger, or open seat). Also included are rankings of Senate and House \n        candidates for the following categories: receipts, individual contributions, \n        PAC and other committee contributions, contributions and loans from the \n        candidate, disbursements, cash-on-hand, and debts owed. Six-year financial \n        summaries of Senate candidates for 2004, as well as current cycle financial \n        summaries for each House campaign are also attached. </p>\n      <p>This release and the data contained in it are also available on the FEC's \n        web site at <em><u>http://www.fec.gov </u></em><u/>under News Releases \n        or Campaign Finance Reports and Data. </p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <hr/>\n      <p align=\"left\">&#160; </p>\n      <p align=\"center\">Footnotes </p>\n      <p>&#160; </p>\n      <p>&#149;&#160; Figures in the first two tables and the detailed listings \n        of candidates cover from January 1, 2003, or whenever the campaign registered \n        during the year, through June 30, 2004.</p>\n      <p>&#149;&#160; Net receipt and net disbursement figures are total receipts \n        and total disbursements, as reported by the campaigns, minus any money \n        transferred between committees of the same campaign. </p>\n      <p>&#149;&#160; Columns entitled &#147;Contrib from Other Cmte's&#148; are monies \n        contributed to campaigns by PACs and other committees as reported by the \n        campaigns.
