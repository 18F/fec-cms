The law in effect at the time \n    provided for a specific exception for contributions to building fund \n    accounts. </p>\n    <p>According to the conciliation agreement, Fannie Mae donated $51,470 to \n    the Republican Governors? Association and these funds were deposited in the \n    Republican National State Elections Committee account of the RNC. The RNC \n    also improperly deposited $250,000 received from the Federal Home Loan \n    Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac\") in its general nonfederal account in \n    2001 even though the donation had been properly designated for the building \n    fund.</p>\n    <p>Fannie Mae also made donations of $50,000 to the 1999 Senate-House Dinner \n    Committee and $100,000 to the 2000 House-Senate Dinner Committee that did \n    not contain specific building fund designations at the time the donations \n    were made. The Dinner Committees did, however, deposit the donations in \n    building fund accounts.</p>\n    <p>The Commission also found that the NRSC improperly deposited three \n    different donations it received from Freddie Mac (totaling $130,250) into \n    nonfederal accounts not designated as building funds. These donations were \n    refunded in 2001 ($130,000) and 2003 ($250). The FEC voted to take no \n    further action against Freddie Mac but sent it an admonishment letter \n    regarding a donation made to the National Republican Congressional Committee \n    (NRCC) without a designation to a building fund. This donation was properly \n    deposited by the NRCC. </p>\n    <p/>\n    <p>The investigation stemmed from a complaint filed with the FEC by John \n    Berthoud, President of the National Taxpayers Union.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th valign=\"top\" colspan=\"3\">COMPLIANCE CASE MADE PUBLIC</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" colspan=\"3\">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Election \n    Commission has recently made public its final action on one matter \n    previously under review (MURs).
