On June 11, the Commission concluded that m-Qube, Inc.&#8217;s proposal that would allow political committees to use mobile phone text messaging to collect contributions is consistent with the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) and Commission regulations and conforms to the Act&#8217;s prohibition on corporate contributions. The Commission further concluded that the proposal does not implicate the contribution forwarding requirements of the Act and satisfies the segregation requirement for commercial vendors that process political contributions.</p>\n        <p><u/></p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?AONUMBER=2012-19\"><strong>AO 2012-19 (American Future Fund)</strong></a><strong>.</strong> American Future Fund intends to produce and distribute certain broadcast advertisements and asks whether or not any of its proposed ads refer to a clearly identified candidate and therefore are electioneering communications. On June 13, the Commission concluded that two of AFF&#8217;s eight proposed advertisements would constitute electioneering communications, and one of the proposed advertisements would not constitute an electioneering communication. The Commission could not approve a response by the required four affirmative votes about the remaining proposed advertisements.
