This brings\n    to <u><strong>43</strong></u> the total number of cases released thus far. The\n    program&#146;s goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement matters, reduce the cost\n    of processing complaints, and enhance overall FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated\n    settlement summaries are available in the FEC&#146;s Press and Public Records offices.<p>For\n    a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage\n    in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is\n    pending in the ADR Office, and agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if\n    necessary, mediation.</p>\n    <p>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching an expedient resolution\n    with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both satisfying to the respondent(s) and in\n    compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions reached through\n    direct and, when necessary, mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for\n    final approval. If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds\n    by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved through ADR are\n    not precedential.</p>\n    <p align=\"RIGHT\">&#160;</p>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"9\" width=\"100%\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"5%\">1.</td>\n        <td width=\"30%\">ADR #069</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"5%\"/>\n        <td width=\"30%\"/>\n        <td width=\"65%\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"5%\"/>\n        <td width=\"30%\">RESPONDENTS:</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\">Gejdenson Reelection Committee, Sally Cini, assistant treasurer</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"5%\"/>\n        <td width=\"30%\">SOURCE:</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\">FEC Initiated &#150; Audit Referral</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"5%\"/>\n        <td width=\"30%\">SUBJECT:</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\">Excessive contributions</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"5%\"/>\n        <td width=\"30%\">NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT:</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\">$3,000 civil penalty<p>Respondent has agreed to terminate the committee.</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"5%\"/>\n        <td width=\"30%\"/>\n        <td width=\"65%\"/>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"100%\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "date": "10/29/2002", "href": "20021029adr.html", "category": "Enforcement Matters", "title": "ADR Program Resolves Case", "pdf": null}
