Petersen as Chairman and Steven T. Walther as Vice Chairman for 2016. The Commission also approved an initial <a href=\"../../../agenda/2015/documents/mtgdoc_15-66-a-1.pdf\">schedule</a> of meeting dates for the first six months of 2016.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <strong>ADVISORY OPINIONS<br/>\n  <br/>\n  </strong><u>Advisory Opinions Considered and Extensions of Time Received<br/>\n  </u><strong><br/>\n  </strong><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">Advisory Opinion 2015-13 (Reid)</a>. On December 17, the Commission discussed two draft advisory opinions in response to a request from Senator Harry Reid, but held over a vote on the matter.&#160; Senator Reid asks whether he may use campaign funds to pay the costs of an assistant after his retirement and whether his leadership PAC may, after Senator Reid retires, pay the winding down costs of his Senate office. On December 17, the Commission received an Extension of Time until January 25, 2016 on Advisory Opinion Request 2015-13.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">Advisory Opinion 2015-14 (Hillary for America II)</a>. On December 17, the Commission discussed two draft advisory opinions in response to a request from Hillary for America, but held over a vote on the matter. Hillary for America asks whether a student interning with the campaign may accept a stipend and academic credit from her university under an exception to the general prohibition on corporate contributions to campaigns. On December 17, the Commission received an Extension of Time until January 25, 2016 on Advisory Opinion Request 2015-14.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <u>Request Received<br/>\n  </u><br/>\n  <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1323315.pdf\">Advisory Opinion Request 2015-16 (Niger Innis for Congress)</a>. On December 15, the Commission made public Advisory Opinion Request 2015-16, submitted by Niger Innis for Congress, a principal campaign committee that is winding down. The requestor asks whether it may pay certain costs associated with general election contributions from general election funds, rather than primary election funds, and whether it may donate general election contributions to a charity, rather than disgorge the funds to the U.S. Treasury. The Commission must issue a response no later than 60 days after receipt of the complete request, that is, by February 16, 2016.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <strong>ENFORCEMENT<br/>\n  <br/>\n  </strong>The Commission made public two closed cases and a Statement of Reasons, as follows. For more information, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6535</a><br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: J. Gerald Hebert, Campaign Legal Center<br/>\n  RESPONDENT: Restore Our Future and Charles R. Spies in his official capacity as treasurer; and Romney for President, Inc. and Darrell Crate, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that independent expenditure-only political committee Restore Our Future and Spies, in his official capacity as treasurer (ROF), made and Romney for President, Inc. and Crate, in his official capacity as treasurer (Romney for President), accepted &#160;a prohibited in-kind contribution when ROF financed the republication of a television advertisement prepared by Romney, his campaign committees or authorized agents. The complaint alleged further that ROF failed to report the contributions when it republished Romney for President campaign materials. Mitt Romney was a 2012 candidate for U.S. President.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found reason to believe ROF made excessive in-kind contributions to Romney for President by republishing campaign materials prepared by Romney for President and failed to report the expenditures as contributions to Romney for President. The Commission entered into a conciliation agreement providing for ROF to pay a civil penalty of $50,000. The Commission found no reason to believe Romney for President accepted excessive or prohibited in-kind contributions from ROF because there was nothing in the record showing that the communication at issue was coordinated with the Romney campaign. Chair Ravel and Commissioner Ellen L. Weintraub issued a <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocsMUR/15044382766.pdf\">Statement of Reasons</a>.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6810</a><br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: Chad Lee Choat<br/>\n  RESPONDENTS: Michael Jeffrey Turner; Mike Turner for Congress and Kyle Walton Denham, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Turner and Mike Turner for Congress and Denham, in his official capacity as treasurer (the Committee), failed to file a Statement of Organization in a timely manner and failed to file a 2014 April Quarterly Report.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the matter. The Commission observed that the Committee claimed that its failure to file the Statement of Organization was due to a clerical effort and that it made an effort to correct the error as soon as it was discovered. The Commission also noted that the Committee apparently made an attempt to timely file its 2014 April Quarterly Report by mailing it to the Commission via First Class Mail on April 15, 2014.<br/>\n  <strong><br/>\n  </strong><strong>ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION<br/>\n  </strong><br/>\n  The Commission made public one campaign finance enforcement matter that was resolved through its Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) program, as follows. For more information, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">ADR 767</a> &#8211; Joe Carr for Senate and Nate Schott, in his official capacity as treasurer.&#160; The respondent agreed to (1) pay a civil penalty of $2,250, and (2) certify the closure of the Committee&#8217;s federal account and work with Commission staff to terminate their political committee status and reporting obligations with the Commission. The Committee will continue reporting until such time as the termination is approved.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <strong>LITIGATION<br/>\n  <em><br/>\n  </em></strong><a href=\"../../../law/litigation/CCP.shtml\"><em>Center for Competitive Politics v.
