If sent by certified or registered mail, the report should have been postmarked by July 5, 2010.</p>\n        <p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal campaign finance law, even though their names may appear on the ballot. If an individual raises or spends $5,000 or less, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the Act.</p>\n        <p>The FEC notified committees involved in the Georgia primary elections of their potential filing requirements on June 14, 2010. Those committees that did not file on the due date were sent notification on July 9, 2010 that their reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n        <p>Other political committees that support Senate and House candidates in elections, but are not authorized committees of a candidate's campaign, are also required to file quarterly reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n        <p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions, and the FEC has implemented an Administrative Fine program with provisions for assessing monetary penalties. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p/>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. </em></p>\n        <p align=\"center\"/>\n        <p align=\"center\"># # #</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n", "href": "press2010/20100716NonFiler.shtml", "date": "07/16/2010", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Cites Committee for Failure to File 12-Day Pre-Primary Financial Report", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
