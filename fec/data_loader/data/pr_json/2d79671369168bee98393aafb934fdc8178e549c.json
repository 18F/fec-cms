The Commission concluded that because the 1787 National Committee, Inc. (1787) has not yet placed any candidates for federal office on any ballot, 1787 does not yet come within the definition of a &#8220;political party&#8221; under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) and Commission regulations. Accordingly, 1787 is not yet the &#8220;national committee&#8221; of a political party within the meaning of the Act and Commission regulations.&#160; During the open meeting discussion, the Commission heard from the Chairman of the 1787 National Committee, Inc.</p>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. </em></p>\n        <p align=\"center\"># # #</p></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>      </div>\n           "}
