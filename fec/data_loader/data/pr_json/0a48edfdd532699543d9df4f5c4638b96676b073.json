It is now possible\nto retrieve lists of individuals who have contributed $200 or\nmore to federal political committees, as well as lists of PACs or\nparty committees that have contributed to specific candidates.\nYou can also see lists of candidates to whom selected PACs or\nparties have contributed.</font></p>\n\n<p><font face=\"Book Antiqua\">You can find the search process on\nthe World Wide Web by pointing to </font><a href=\"http://www.fec.gov\"><font face=\"Book Antiqua\"><i>http://www.fec.gov</i></font></a><font face=\"Book Antiqua\"> and choosing the link to \"View\nContributions and Financial Reports Filed by Presidential and\nHouse campaigns, Parties and PACs.\" From there you can\nchoose to look at images of original reports, examine reports\nfiled electronically, or use the new query process to examine\n1997-98 information in detail. You can search for a specific\nindividual, look at a particular PAC&#146;s contributions, or\nfind out which PACs and individuals have contributed to a\nparticular candidate. </font></p>\n\n<p><font face=\"Book Antiqua\">This represents another step in the\nCommission&#146;s continuing effort to provide campaign finance\ninformation to the public in the most accessible way possible.\nSince 1996, the FEC has provided free comprehensive computer\nfiles containing campaign finance information dating back nearly\n20 years on the Internet. Images of actual campaign finance\nreports were added to the FEC&#146;s Web site in early 1998, and\nwill soon include reports back to 1993.</font></p>\n\n<p><font face=\"Book Antiqua\">This new service allows for on-line\nsearching of the current election cycle data with immediate\nretrieval of the most up-to-date information available. The\ninformation on this portion of the FEC&#146;s Web site will be\nupdated daily, just as the Commission&#146;s computer data are\nupdated every night.</font></p>\n\n<p><font face=\"Book Antiqua\">There will be more changes to the\nFEC&#146;s Internet materials in the future.</font></p>\n</body>\n"}
