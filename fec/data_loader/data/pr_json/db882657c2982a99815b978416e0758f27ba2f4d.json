The Federal Election Commission (FEC/the Commission) today announced final action in seven enforcement cases, four of which led to civil penalties totaling $100,100.</p>\n              <p>The Commission completed action in these matters in 2007 and documents from these cases have now been included on the public record.&#160; Detailed information on all FEC enforcement actions is available through the Enforcement Query System at <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs</a>. </p>\n              <p>In Matter Under Review (MUR) 5916, the Colorado Democratic Party (CDP) agreed to pay a civil penalty of $45,000 for violating the Federal Election Campaign Act&#8217;s (the Act) reporting requirements.&#160; During 2003 and 2004, the committee misreported receipts and disbursements on FEC disclosure reports.&#160; CDP failed to report $325,700.98 in receipts and disbursements in its original 2003 Mid-Year Report; $360,316.00 in receipts in its original 2004 October Monthly Report; $949,253.86 in receipts and disbursements in its original 2004 Pre-General Report; and $575,213.38 in receipts in its original 2004 Post-General Report.&#160; As part of a conciliation agreement with the Commission, the committee agreed to pay the civil penalty and cease and desist from committing future similar violations.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5741, the Charlie Melancon Campaign Committee, Inc., the principal campaign committee of 2004 Congressional candidate Charles Melancon (LA/03), agreed to pay a civil penalty of $42,000 for failing to disclose all financial activity on its 2004 30 Day Post-Runoff Report.&#160; The committee originally disclosed $50,971.78 in disbursements on its Post-Runoff Report.&#160; An amended version of the report later disclosed $656,823.30 in additional disbursements.&#160; The committee agreed to pay the civil penalty and cease and desist from committing future similar violations.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5917, Simmons for Congress, the principal campaign committee of 2006 Congressional candidate Rob Simmons (CT/02), agreed to pay a civil penalty of $9,500 for failing to disclose all financial activity on its 2006 12 Day Pre-General Report.&#160; The committee originally disclosed $316,153.13 in disbursements on its Pre-General Report.&#160; An amended version of the report later disclosed $225,018 in additional disbursements.&#160; The committee agreed to pay the civil penalty and cease and desist from committing future similar violations.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5889, Republicans for Trauner (RFT), a committee active in the 2006 general election for U.S. Representative from Wyoming, agreed to pay a $3,600 civil penalty for violating multiple provisions of the Act.&#160; RFT included the name of House candidate Gary Trauner (WY), but was not an authorized campaign committee.&#160; During the 2006 election cycle, RFT funded newspaper and radio ads and mailed flyers to homes throughout the state of Wyoming expressly advocating Trauner&#8217;s election.&#160; The Commission found reason to believe RFT violated the Act by using the name of a federal candidate in the name of an unauthorized committee, failing to include adequate disclaimers on public communications, failing to register with the Commission in a timely manner, failing to file FEC disclosure reports on time and accepting excessive and corporate contributions. </p>\n              <p>In MUR 5874, the FEC found no reason to believe the Gunowners of America (GOA) violated the Act.&#160; The complaint alleged GOA made prohibited in-kind contributions to federal candidates by expressly advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates in a 2006 voter guide that appeared on its web site and was included as a link in e-mail action alerts.&#160; The Commission determined the voter guide did not violate the Act because it did not contain words or explicit directives that urged the election of any identified candidates.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5875, the FEC found no reason to believe the National Rifle Association (NRA) and its political action committee, the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund (NRAPVF), violated the Act by making in-kind contributions to federal candidates by expressly advocating the election or defeat of federal candidates.&#160; The complaint primarily concerned activities conducted by the NRAPVF during October of 2006 on portions of its web site that were available to the general public and were not password protected.&#160; The complaint alleged those portions of the web site engaged in activities that should only have been accessible to NRA members.&#160; The Commission concluded that the action alerts and links were permissible under federal campaign finance law.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5876, a complaint alleged that the Bowman for Congress Campaign Committee, the principal campaign committee of Dr. Robert Bowman (FL/15), violated the Act by using the resources of the Institute for Space and Security Studies (ISSS), a tax exempt organization, to produce and mail a newsletter supporting Bowman&#8217;s candidacy.&#160; The committee denied any use of ISSS resources, but indicated that it had used the non-profit organization mailing permit of a firm ISSS used for mailings when the committee mailed campaign materials.&#160; The committee promptly reimbursed the U.S. Post Office when it became aware of the violation.&#160; The FEC admonished the campaign committee and took no further action.</p>\n              <p>Under the law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases or Matters Under Review through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group the Commission determines has violated the law.&#160;

In January of 2004 and June of 2004, the committee filed amendments to that report disclosing additional receipts totaling $99,027.25 and additional disbursements totaling $226,673.73.&#160; In October of 2004, the committee filed its original October Monthly Report and filed an amendment to the report in August of 2005, disclosing an additional $360,316.00 in receipts.&#160; In October of 2004, the committee filed an original 2004 Pre-General Election Report.&#160; The committee amended the Pre-General Election Report five times, disclosing an additional $211,668.71 in receipts and $737,585.15 in disbursements.&#160; The committee filed an original 2004 Post-General Election Report in December of 2004 and later filed six amended versions of the report, disclosing an additional $575,213.38 in disbursements.&#160; In January of 2004, respondents filed an original 2003 Year-End Report.&#160; The report was later amended to disclose an ending cash-on-hand balance of $99,994.64.&#160;&#160; In April of 2004, the committee filed its original April Quarterly Report.&#160; The committee later amended the April Quarterly, disclosing that its beginning cash-on-hand balance was $30,526.67.&#160; There was a discrepancy between the reported cash-on-hand totaling $69,671.71.</p>\n                      <p>The committee contended that the errors and omissions in disclosure were not intentional.&#160;

RFT&#8217;s advertisements failed to include adequate disclaimers. </p>\n                      <p>Commission review of disclosure reports showed that RFT exceeded the $1,000 registration threshold on September 28, 2006.&#160;

Independent expenditures totaling $24,894.52 should have been disclosed in 24-Hour Reports because those expenditures were made within 20 days of the election.&#160; RFT&#8217;s reports also revealed the acceptance of excessive contributions and prohibited corporate contributions.</p>\n                      <p>RFT contended they had no prior experience or expertise with federal election law and that their violations were oversights that were not intended to violate the Act.&#160; RFT further contended that, upon the discovery of violations, they promptly made efforts to bring the committee into compliance.</p>\n                      <p>The Commission found reason to believe the respondents violated the Act by using the name of a federal candidate in the name of an unauthorized committee, failing to include adequate disclaimers on public communications, failing to register in a timely manner with the FEC, failing to file timely disclosure reports and accepting excessive contributions and corporate contributions.&#160;
