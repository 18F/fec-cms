This brings\n    to <u><strong>42</strong></u> the total number of cases released thus far. The\n    program&#146;s goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement matters, reduce the cost\n    of processing complaints, and enhance overall FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated\n    settlement summaries are available in the FEC&#146;s Press and Public Records offices.<p>For\n    a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage\n    in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is\n    pending in the ADR Office, and agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if\n    necessary, mediation.</p>\n    <p>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching an expeditious\n    resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both satisfying to the\n    respondent(s) and in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions\n    reached through direct and, when necessary, mediated negotiations are submitted to the\n    Commissioners for final approval. If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation,\n    the case proceeds to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved through ADR are not\n    precedential.</p>\n    <p align=\"RIGHT\">&#160;</p>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"100%\">\n      <tr>\n        <th valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"ten_pt\">1.</th>\n        <th valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"ten_pt\">ADR 027</th>\n        <td valign=\"top\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"ten_pt\"/>\n        <th valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"ten_pt\"/>\n        <td valign=\"top\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"ten_pt\"/>\n        <th valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" class=\"ten_pt\">RESPONDENTS:</th>\n        <td valign=\"top\">(a) Friends and Farmers for Rich Rodriguez for Congress Committee, Craig\n        Boone, treasurer (CA)<p>(b) Rich Rodriguez (CA)</p>\n        <p>(c) Gilkey Enterprises (CA)</p>\n        <p>(d) Manzanillo Ranch (CA)</p>\n        <p>(e) Tiemersma Dairy (CA)</p>\n        <p>(f) Panoche Ginning Company (CA)</p>\n        <p>(g) Sierra Vista Pharmacy (CA)</p>\n        <p>(h) Tres Panoche Land Company (CA)</p>\n        <p>(i) Grapery (CA) </p>\n        <p>(j) Willemina Dairy (CA)</p>\n        <p>(k) Peggy Stefanopoulos (CA)</p>\n        <p>(l) GFW Power Systems Company, Inc.
