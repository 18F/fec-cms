One case was dismissed.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>The FEC&#8217;s ADR program has proven effective at resolving basic violations quickly and reducing the agency&#8217;s costs for completing enforcement actions. Since its inception in October 2000, the ADR program has resolved 483 cases.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>The ADR process is designed to reach an expedited resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act). For a case to be considered for the ADR program, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is being resolved and participate in mediation, if appropriate. Settlements reached through ADR participation are submitted to the Commission for final approval. </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>Negotiated settlement agreements include provisions ranging from paying civil penalties to developing internal control policies to attending FEC conferences providing training in areas such as fundraising and reporting rules. Summaries of the agreements are available on the FEC&#8217;s website and at its Public Records Office.
