This brings to \n    102 the total number of cases released, since the ADR program began October \n    2, 2000. The program&#146;s goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement \n    matters, reduce the cost of processing complaints, and enhance overall FEC \n    enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available in the \n    FEC&#146;s Press and Public Records offices.<p>For a case to be considered for \n    ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR \n    process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is \n    pending in the ADR Office, and agree to participate in bilateral \n    negotiations and, if necessary, mediation.</p>\n    <p>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching an \n    expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both \n    satisfying to the respondent(s) and in compliance with the Federal Election \n    Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions reached through direct and, when necessary, \n    mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval. \n    If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds \n    by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved \n    through ADR are not precedential.</p>\n    <p align=\"RIGHT\"/>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\" valign=\"TOP\">1.</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">ADR 147</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">RESPONDENTS:</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"TOP\">Friends of Farr, Sidney Slade, treasurer<p>\n        Representative Sam Farr</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">SOURCE:</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"TOP\">MUR 5371: Mark Risley</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">SUBJECT:</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"TOP\">Failure to accurately report candidate \n        loan; failure to report employee payroll taxes; improper use of campaign \n        funds.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT:</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"TOP\">The ADR Office recommends the case be \n        closed and the Commission agrees to close the file.</td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p/>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  </table>\n</body>\n", "href": "press2004/20040330adr.html", "date": "03/30/2004", "pdf": null, "title": "ADR Program Resolves Case", "category": "Enforcement Matters"}
