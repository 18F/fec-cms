They have outraised their Democratic counterparts by more than 70%.\nDemocratic Party national committees reported $172.7million in receipts and $153.5 million\nin disbursements. </p>\n\n<p>These <b>\"hard dollar\"</b> receipts are a modest 6% higher for Republicans\nthan in the previous presidential election cycle (1995-96), and 24% higher for Democratic\ncommittees. The Democrats reported a 15% increase in disbursements, while the Republicans\nspent 7% less than in 1996.</p>\n\n<p>As they entered the last weeks of the campaign, Republican committees had $42.7 million\ncash-on-hand, while Democratic committees&#146; cash totalled $23 million.</p>\n\n<p>In the area of candidate support, Republican national committees have spent three times\nas much as Democratic national committees. Republicans spent a total of $23.6 million for\ntheir candidates, including $1.5 million in direct contributions, $21.6 million in\ncoordinated expenditures*, and $549,400 in independent expenditures. Democrats spent $8.3\nmillion to promote their candidates, with $888,422 in direct contributions, $7.4 million\nin coordinated expenditures, and $76,745 in independent expenditures. </p>\n\n<p>The largest percentage increases for both parties continue to be in non-federal, or <b>\"soft\nmoney\"</b> (funds raised outside the limitations and prohibitions of the Federal\nElection Campaign Act). Republicans have raised nearly $211 million, an increase of 74%\nover the same period in 1995-96, the last presidential cycle, while Democrats raised\nalmost $199 million, a 85% increase. Soft money now represents 42% of all National\nRepublican Party financial activity and 53% of Democratic National Party fundraising.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the activity of national party committees in recent election cycles has shifted\ntoward transfers of funds from the national committees to the various states. In total,\nthe national committees of the Democratic Party transferred $147.2 million to the various\nstates. The national committees of the Republican Party transferred $136.6 million. Hard\ndollar transfers by the Democrats totaled $40.7 million. Republicans transferred $38\nmillion in hard dollars. Soft money transfers totalled $106.5 million for the Democrats\nand $98.5 million for the Republicans. These transfers to the states are listed on the\nlast two pages of this release. </p>\n\n<p>Charts attached to this release provide comparable data for five previous election\ncycles (four cycles for \"soft money\").</p>\n\n<p>*</p></font><font size=\"2\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Coordinated expenditures are monies spent by\nnational and state party committees on general election nominees and are in addition to\ncontributions.
