FEC</u> and <u>Bush-Cheney &#8217;04 v. FEC</u>, challenged the Commission&#8217;s decision not to change the political committee definition. The Court denied the plaintiffs&#8217; request to order the Commission to issue new regulations.&#160; Instead, the Court remanded the case to the Commission and provided the Commission with the option of further articulating reasons for its decisions.&#160; Pursuant to the Court&#8217;s order, the Commission intends to prepare a more thorough explanation of the rulemaking decisions at issue.</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p>Documents related to this case can be found on the Commission&#8217;s Web Site at <a href=\"../../law/litigation_CCA_Alpha.shtml#shays_02\">http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation_CCA_Alpha.shtml#shays_02</a>.</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p align=\"center\"><strong># # #</strong></p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p/></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n"}
