RIVERA, TREAS...REV ALFRED C. SHARPTON...DEM</p>\n\n<p>The report was due May 20, and should have detailed financial activity from \nApril 1, 2004 through April 30, 2004. Presidential candidates who accept public \nfunding must file their reports electronically. The disclosure report should \nhave been filed by midnight, May 20, 2004.</p>\n<p>On May 27, 2004, the committee was notified by mailgram that the FEC had not \nreceived the monthly report. The campaign had four business days from the date \nof the mailgram to respond. Failure to file by June 4, 2004 resulted in this \npublication. Prior notification of the required filing was sent to the committee \non March 22.</p>\n<p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a \ncase-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate \nenforcement actions and the FEC has implemented a new administrative fine \nprogram which will subject committees to penalties ranging from $30 to $16,000 \nor more.</p>\n<p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure report for presidential committees \nwill be the June monthly report, due June 20<b>. </b>It will cover activity from \nMay 1 through May 31.</p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"/>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p>\n</font>\n</body>\n"}
