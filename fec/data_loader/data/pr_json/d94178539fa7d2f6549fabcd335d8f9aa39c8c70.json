The\nprogram&#146;s goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement matters, reduce the cost\nof processing complaints, and enhance overall FEC enforcement. </p>\n\n<p>For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to\nengage in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is\npending in the ADR Office, and agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if\nnecessary, mediation. </p>\n\n<p>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching an expedient resolution\nin a manner that is both satisfying to the respondent(s) and in compliance with the\nFederal Election Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions reached in negotiations are submitted to\nthe Commissioners for final approval. If a resolution is not reached in bilateral\nnegotiation, the case proceeds to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved\nthrough ADR are not precedential.</p>\n\n<p>Closed ADR negotiated settlements&#146; summaries are available in the FEC&#146;s\nPublic Records Office. This initial case (below) was received in the ADR Office on October\n13 and a negotiated agreement reached on November 7.</p>\n\n<p><u><b>ADR 004</b></u></p>\n\n<p><b>RESPONDENT</b>: FJC Corporation</p>\n\n<p><b>REFERRED BY:</b> Small Business Administration (SBA)</p>\n\n<p><b>SUBJECT:</b> Corporate Contribution</p>\n\n<p><b>NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT: </b>$850 civil penalty</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p/></font>&#160;\n</body>\n", "href": "122100adr.htm", "date": "12/21/2000", "pdf": null, "title": "ADR Program in Place, First Case Resolved & Certified", "category": "Enforcement Matters"}
