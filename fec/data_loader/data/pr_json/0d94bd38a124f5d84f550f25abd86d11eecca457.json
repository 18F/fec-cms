Federal Political Action Committees raised $376 \n    million, spent $288.1 million, and contributed $105.7 million to federal \n    candidates during 2003 according to a Federal Election Commission (FEC) \n    summary released today. This represented a 19% increase in receipts when \n    compared with 2001, while disbursements increased by 16%. Contributions to \n    candidates were 6% higher than the last non-election year. These changes \n    were generally consistent with the pattern of growth in PAC activity over \n    the past several election cycles. This is the first cycle conducted under \n    the regulatory structure created by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of \n    2002.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    The summary tables provided below also show contributions to candidates \n    broken down by office and party. Unlike previous non-election years, \n    contributions to House Democratic candidates were lower for Corporate, \n    Labor, Non-connected, and Trade/Membership/Health PACs than they had been in \n    2001. Contributions to House Republican candidates from these PACs increased \n    at rates generally similar to years past. PAC contributions to Senate \n    candidates vary from one election cycle to the next because different states \n    have Senate elections each cycle; with only 33 or 34 races each year, the \n    competitiveness of individual races can significantly effect financial \n    activity overall.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    PACs ended 2003 with $269.4 million on hand, 20% more than was available \n    when they entered the 2002 election year. They reported outstanding debts of \n    $8 million which was 8% lower than at the end of 2001.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    The tables on the following pages provide summaries of PAC financial \n    activity including contributions to federal candidates, and also list the \n    top 50 PACs for 2003 in terms of receipts, contributions to candidates, and \n    cash on hand.</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Tables</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Summary of PAC Financial Activity 1993-2003&#160; [<a href=\"pac_summary_history.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n    [<a href=\"pac_summary_history.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">PAC Contributions to Candidates 1993-2003&#160; [<a href=\"pac_contrib_history.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n    [<a href=\"pac_contrib_history.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Chart - PAC Receipts by Type&#160; [<a href=\"pacreceipthistorychart.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n    [<a href=\"pacreceipthistorychart.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Chart - PAC Contributions to Candidates by PAC Type&#160; [<a href=\"paccontribhistorychart.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n    [<a href=\"paccontribhistorychart.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Top 50 PACs by Receipts January 1, 2003 - December 31, 2003&#160; \n    [<a href=\"top_50_pac_receipts.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"top_50_pac_receipts.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Top 50 PACs by Contributions to Candidates January 1, 2003 - \n    December 31, 2003&#160; [<a href=\"top_50_pac_contrib.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"top_50_pac_contrib.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Top 50 PACs by Cash on Hand as of December 31, 2003 [<a href=\"top_50_pac_cash.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n    [<a href=\"top_50_pac_cash.pdf\">PDF</a>]<br/>\n    &#160;</p><p align=\"left\">Excel file containing 2003 receipts, contributions, \n    and cash on hand for all active PACs [<a href=\"paclist.xls\">EXCEL</a>]<br/>\n    ###<br/>\n&#160;</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  </table>\n</body>\n", "date": "03/23/2004", "href": "press2004/20040323pacstat/20040323pacstat.html", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries", "title": "PACs Maintain Growth Trend in 2003", "pdf": null}
