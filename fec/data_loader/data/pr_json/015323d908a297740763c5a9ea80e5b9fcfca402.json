The FEC\nreceived only two comments in response to the NPRM.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The final regulations\nspecify that if Presidential candidates and their authorized\ncommittees have computerized their campaign finance records, they\nmust agree to participate in the Commission&#146;s recently\nestablished electronic filing program as a condition of accepting\nfederal funding. </font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The goals of the new system\ninclude the enhancement of on-line access to reports on file with\nthe Commission, the reduction of paper filing and manual\nprocessing , and the promotion of more efficient and more\ncost-effective methods of operation for filers and for the\nCommission. Electronic filing of Presidential committees&#146;\nreports is intended to save a substantial amount of time and\nCommission resources that would otherwise be devoted to inputting\nthese reports into the FEC&#146;s database.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">These regulations implement\nthe provisions of the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and\nthe Presidential Matching Payment Account Act, which establish\neligibility requirements for Presidential candidates seeking\npublic financing, as well as Public Law 104-79, which amended the\nreporting provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of\n1971.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The FEC sent the proposed\nfinal rules to Congress on August 21. The announcement of\neffective date will be published after these regulations have\nbeen before Congress for 30 legislative days.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The full text of the final\nrules governing electronic filing of reports by Presidential\ncampaign committees appears in the August 27 Federal Register,\npages 45679 and 45680. Also, it may be obtained from the\nFEC&#146;s Website, <i>www.fec.gov</i>, and the FEC Faxline,\n(202) 501-3413.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\"/>&#160;</p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\"/>&#160;</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><font face=\"Book Antiqua\"># # #</font></p>\n</body>\n"}
