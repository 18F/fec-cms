The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has entered into \n    conciliation agreements with Charles Kushner, a New Jersey-based real estate \n    developer, and 40 partnership entities he controls. The agreements settle an \n    investigation stemming from over $500,000 in contributions that the \n    partnerships made without obtaining the agreement of the individual partners \n    to whom the contributions were attributed. The contributions were made \n    between December 5, 1997 and August 17, 2000 for the 1999-2000 election \n    cycle. Recipients of these contributions included 13 candidate committees, \n    one party committee and one PAC.<p>The conciliation agreement with the \n    Kushner Respondents resulted in a civil penalty of $508,900. The Kushner \n    Respondents also agreed to cease and desist from making partnership \n    contributions without obtaining the actual agreement of the partners to whom \n    the contributions were attributed.</p>\n    <p>The Commission also accepted a conciliation agreement with Bill Bradley \n    for President in which the committee admitted to violation the Act by \n    accepting $34,000 in contributions from the Kushner Partnerships and paid a \n    civil penalty of $16,445. </p>\n    <p>The FEC investigation found that the Kushner partnerships violated \n    Commission partnership contribution regulations by failing to obtain the \n    agreement of the partners to whom the contributions were attributed. Charles \n    Kushner, as managing partner of each partnership, determined the partners to \n    whom the contributions would be attributed. Charles Kushner also selected \n    the federal political committees that would receive contributions and \n    determined the aggregate amount of these contributions. He signed the \n    contribution checks and directed management personnel of Kushner Companies \n    to forward the checks on Kushner Companies letterhead to the recipient \n    committees.</p>\n    <p>A partnership is a \"person\" under the Federal Election Campaign Act and, \n    subject to other limits and prohibitions, may make federal political \n    contributions. In order to prevent partnerships controlled by the same \n    persons from being used to evade contribution limits and prohibitions, \n    regulations treat partnership contributions as counting towards the \n    contribution limits of both the partnership and the specific partners to \n    whom the contributions are attributed.</p>\n    <p>By failing to notify and obtain the agreement of the partners, the \n    respondents caused certain partners to make contributions that exceeded \n    their annual contribution limit and attributed contributions to some \n    individuals who were not partners in the contributing partnerships at the \n    time the contributions were made.</p>\n    <p/>\n    <p>The matter originated with a referral from the FEC?s Audit Division, \n    which uncovered the Kushner Respondents? practices during an audit of the \n    Bill Bradley for President Committee. </p>\n    <p/>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">1.</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">MUR 5279</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">RESPONDENTS:</td>\n        <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">(a) Kushner, Charles\n        <p>(b) 135 Montgomery Associates </p>\n        <p>(c) 836 Avenue Associates </p>\n        <p>(d) BP Developers, L.P. </p>\n        <p>(e) Brick Building Associates, L.P. </p>\n        <p>(f) Bruckner Plaza Associates </p>\n        <p>(g) Colfax Manor, L.P. </p>\n        <p>(h) College Park Associates, L.P. </p>\n        <p>(i) Constantine Village Associates </p>\n        <p>(j) Dara Building Associates, L.P. </p>\n        <p>(k) East Brunswick Corporate Center </p>\n        <p>(l) Edgewater Apartments Associates, L.P. </p>\n        <p>(m) Elmwood V.
