This is a 16% increase in\nreceipts for both parties when compared to the same period of 1997-98. When compared to\nthe same period in 1995-96, the last presidential cycle, Republicans registered a 4%\ndecrease in receipts, while the Democrats showed a 37% increase in receipts.</p>\n\n<p>Contributions from individuals constituted the bulk of the receipts for both parties.\nRepublicans reported $59.4 million from individuals and $3.9 million from PACs. Democrats\nreported $29.2 million from individuals and $4.5 million from PACs. In addition, Democrats\nhad $12.4 million cash on hand and debts of $5.4 million while the Republicans reported\ncash on hand of $15.9 million and debts of $2.5 million. </p>\n\n<p>Both political parties continued to raise record amounts of soft money. Republicans\nraised $30.9 million in soft money for the first six months of this year, a 42% increase\nwhen compared to the first six months of the 1997-98 election cycle. Democrats raised\n$26.4 million, a 93% increase. Soft money describes funds raised outside the limitations\nand prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act, and must be deposited in separate\nnon-federal accounts, not to be used in connection with federal elections.</p>\n\n<p>Charts attached to this release provide summary data for the financial activities of\nthe two major parties during the first six months for the 1997-98 election cycle and\ncomparisons for the same period in the previous five election cycles. Comparable data on\nnon-federal party activity are available for only the previous four elections. The FEC\nbegan requiring national party committees to disclose their non-federal accounts in\nJanuary 1991. </p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\">-more-</p>\n\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"../finance/repfed99.htm\">Republican Party Federal\nActivity</a></p>\n\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"../finance/demfed99.htm\">Democratic Party Federal\nActivity</a></p>\n\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"../finance/repsft99.htm\">Republican Party\nNon-Federal Activity</a></p>\n\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"../finance/demsft99.htm\">Democratic Party\nNon-Federal Activity</a></p>\n\n<p align=\"left\"><a href=\"../finance/sftlng99.htm\">Non-Federal Summary</a></p>\n<b>\n\n</b><p>&#160;</p>\n</font>\n</body>\n", "href": "ptymy99.htm", "date": "09/22/1999", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Releases Fundraising Figures of Major Political Parties - Large Gain in Soft Money Contributions", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries"}
