O&#8217;Malley for the 2016 primary election. The certified amount was in  response to the second regular submission for matching funds made by the  O&#8217;Malley campaign. <br/>\n  <br/>\n          In November, O&#8217;Malley became the first 2016 presidential candidate to be  declared eligible by the Commission to receive federal matching funds. Based on his initial threshold submission and his  first regular submission, the Commission requested United States Treasury payments  to the O&#8217;Malley campaign totaling $946,365.09. <br/>\n  <br/>\n          Following the tally vote completed yesterday, the Commission will request the  Treasury to make a payment of $133,696.74 to O&#8217;Malley for President. This sum includes an additional  $14,219.55 the Commission determined to be due to O&#8217;Malley for President based  on a revised review of the committee&#8217;s first regular submission. O&#8217;Malley, a  Democrat, ended his presidential campaign last month.<br/>\n  <br/>\n          To become eligible for matching funds, candidates must raise a threshold amount  of $100,000 by collecting $5,000 in 20 different states. Although an individual  may contribute up to $2,700 to a primary candidate in the current election  cycle, only a maximum of $250 per individual is matched with funds from the  Presidential Election Campaign Fund. <br/>\n  <br/>\n          Other requirements to be declared eligible include agreeing to an overall  spending limit, abiding by spending limits in each state, using public funds  only for legitimate campaign-related expenses, keeping financial records and  permitting an audit of campaign financial activity. <br/>\n  <br/>\n          Materials included with O&#8217;Malley for President&#8217;s submission may be viewed <a href=\"../../../finance/disclosure/2016MatchingFundSubmissions.shtml\">here</a>. <br/>\n  <br/>\n          The presidential public funding program is financed through the $3 check-off  that appears on individual income tax returns. The program now has two  elements: matching payments to participating candidates during the primary  campaign and grants available to nominees to pay for the general election  campaign. On April 3, 2014, President Barack Obama signed legislation to end  the public funding of presidential nomination conventions. <br/>\n  <br/>\n          In connection with the 2012 presidential election, the Commission certified nearly  $1.4 million in federal matching funds to primary election candidates, and $18.2  million to each of the Republican and Democratic parties for their conventions.  The $37.9 million total in public funds certified by the Commission in 2012 was  the lowest amount since the inception of the public funding program in 1976. <br/>\n  <br/>\n          Additional information about the presidential public funding program is  available <a href=\"../../bkgnd/fund.shtml\">here</a>. Income tax check-off data showing monthly deposits into  the program&#8217;s fund is available <a href=\"../../bkgnd/presidential_fund.shtml\">here</a>.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency  that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has  jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of  Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency.  Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners who are nominated  by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.</em></p>\n        <p align=\"center\">&#160;</p>\n        <div align=\"center\">Follow Us on Twitter - <u>http://twitter.com/fec</u><br/>\n</div>\n        <div align=\"left\"/></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>      \n      </div>\n      "}
