FEC</em>.&#160;&#160;</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">At issue was a <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocs/00005801.pdf#page=3\">pamphlet</a> distributed by the Sierra Club in Florida prior to the 2004 general election.&#160; The front of the pamphlet exhorted the reader to &#8220;LET YOUR CONSCIENCE BE YOUR GUIDE,&#8221; accompanied by various nature scenes.&#160; The heading of the interior of the pamphlet urged the reader, &#8220;AND LET YOUR VOTE BE YOUR VOICE.&#8221;&#160; </p>\n      <p align=\"left\">The pamphlet compared the environmental records of President Bush and Senator Kerry and U.S. Senate candidates Mel Martinez and Betty Castor through checkmarks and written narratives.&#160;&#160; Kerry received checkmarks in every box on all three environmental issues addressed in the pamphlet; Bush received only one checkmark in a single category, and in that category, Kerry received two checkmarks.&#160; In the Senate race, Castor received checkmarks in all three categories, while Martinez received none.&#160; The accompanying narratives made clear that a checkmark represented a favorable environmental record in the eyes of the Sierra Club.&#160; The Commission found that the pamphlet &#8220;expressly advocated&#8221; Kerry and Castor&#8217;s election and Bush and Martinez&#8217;s defeat.&#160; </p>\n      <p align=\"left\">Prior to the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in <em>McConnell v. FEC, </em>which upheld most of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, two Federal appeals courts had held that, as a constitutional matter, only communications containing the so-called &#8220;magic words&#8221; could be subject to Federal campaign finance law.&#160; </p>\n      <p align=\"left\">In <em>McConnell</em>, however, the Supreme Court made clear that &#8220;express advocacy&#8221; was not a constitutional boundary &#8220;that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#8221;&#160; </p>\n      <p align=\"left\">Because the Sierra Club brochure contained &#8220;express advocacy,&#8221; it was an &#8220;independent expenditure.&#8221;&#160; Federal law prohibits corporations from using treasury funds to make independent expenditures and all of the funds spent on the brochure by the Sierra Club came from its corporate treasury.&#160; </p>\n      <p align=\"left\">This release contains only disposition information.</p>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"35\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"96\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5634&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5634</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"395\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> Sierra Club, Inc. </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> Edmund A.
