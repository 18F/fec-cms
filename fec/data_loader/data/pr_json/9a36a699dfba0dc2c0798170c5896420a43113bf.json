Meeks (NY/6) and his campaign committee, Meeks for Congress (Committee), in which they agree to pay a $63,000 civil penalty to resolve violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act).&#160; In the agreement, Congressman Meeks&#8217; campaign committee admitted to violating the Act by:</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>using campaign funds to pay for personal expenses of the Congressman;&#160; </li>\n                <li>misstating financial activity;</li>\n                <li>receiving contributions that exceeded the Act&#8217;s limits and source prohibitions; and</li>\n                <li>failing to keep proper records of operating expenditures and contributions made to other political committees.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <p>Congressman Meeks also agreed to refund, using personal funds, $9,812 to his committee for vehicle expenses, in addition to $6,230 for personal trainer expenses and $916 for miscellaneous undocumented credit card expenses previously refunded by the Congressman to the committee during the audit.</p>\n              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n              <p>This enforcement matter was based on an FEC audit report, approved by the Commission on August 17, 2006, covering Meeks for Congress&#8217; financial activity from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2004.&#160; The audit concluded that:</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Meeks for Congress used $16,958 of campaign funds for the personal expenses of Congressman Meeks, in violation of the Act.&#160; These expenses included personal trainer expenses ($6,230), miscellaneous undocumented credit card expenses ($916) and vehicle lease payments and repairs ($9,812).&#160; The Act prohibits any person from converting campaign funds to personal use.&#160; Commission regulations define personal use as the use of campaign funds to pay for any expense of any person that would exist irrespective of the candidate&#8217;s campaign or duties as a federal officeholder.&#160; The Congressman reimbursed the Committee for the miscellaneous credit card expenses and the personal trainer expenses after they were identified in the Commission&#8217;s audit of the Committee.&#160; </li>\n                <li>Meeks for Congress violated the Act by misstating its cash on hand, receipts and disbursements in the aggregate amount of $278,636 on its disclosure reports filed with the Commission in the years 2003 and 2004.</li>\n                <li>During the 2004 election cycle, the Committee received contributions from various individuals totaling $22,900 in excess of their primary election limit and disclosed these funds as general election contributions, in violation of the Act. Since the commencement of the Commission&#8217;s enforcement action, the Committee has refunded the excessive contributions.</li>\n                <li>The Committee received contributions totaling $7,070 from the treasury funds of various corporations and limited liability companies (LLCs) during the 2004 election cycle, in violation of the Act.&#160; The Committee failed to ascertain whether the LLC contributions were permissible, as required by Commission regulations.</li>\n                <li>The Committee also failed to keep proper records of its operating expenditures and its contributions to other political committees, in violation of the Act.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <p>The Commission&#8217;s investigation revealed that a contribution to Meeks for Congress from Advent Capital Management LLC was permissible under FEC regulations.&#160; As a result, the Commission took no further action against Advent Capital.</p>\n              <p>Under the law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases, or Matters Under Review (MURs), through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group the Commission determines has violated the law.&#160; The Commission voted to approve the outcome in this matter on November 28, 2007.&#160; Additional information regarding MURs can be found on the FEC web site at <a href=\"../../em/mur.shtml\">http://www.fec.gov/em/mur.shtml</a>. </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>This release contains only summary information.&#160; For additional details, please consult publicly available documents for each case in the Enforcement Query System (EQS) on the FEC web site at <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs</a>.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p/>\n              <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>MUR</strong><strong> 5895</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>a) Meeks for Congress and Patsy A.
