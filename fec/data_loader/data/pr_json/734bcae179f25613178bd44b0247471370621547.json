In addition, the\n    Commission is considering how the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), along\n    with the Commission&#146;s implementing regulations related to BCRA, may affect the public\n    funding rules. </p>\n    <p>Hearing schedule and panels for the June 6 hearing are:</p>\n    <div align=\"center\"><center><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">9 &#150; 9:15 a.m.</td>\n        <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">Opening statements</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">9:15 &#150; 11 a.m.</td>\n        <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">Donald McGahn, National Republican Congressional Committee<p>Robert\n        Bauer, Perkins Coie</p>\n        <p>Paul Sanford, FECWatch, Center for Responsive Politics</p>\n        <p>Steve Weissman, Campaign Finance Institute</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">11:15 &#150;12:45</td>\n        <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">Kenneth Gross, New York City Host Committee<p>Ki Hong, New\n        York City Host Committee</p>\n        <p>Cheryl Cronin, Boston Host Committee</p>\n        <p>David Passafaro, Boston Host Committee</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">12:45 &#150; 2 p.m.</td>\n        <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">Lunch</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">2 &#150; 3:30 p.m.</td>\n        <td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">Joseph Sandler, Democratic National Committee,<p>Democratic\n        National Convention Committee </p>\n        <p>Neil Reiff, Democratic National Committee,</p>\n        <p>Democratic National Convention Committee</p>\n        <p>Thomas Josefiak, Republican National Committee</p>\n        <p>Charles Spies, Republican National Committee</p></td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    </center></div><p>The NPRM, approved by the Commission on April 3, 2003 would address many\n    of the sections in the current regulations, including:</p><ul>\n      <li>Winding-down costs of publicly funded presidential campaigns,</li>\n      <li>primary expenditure limitations and repayments,</li>\n      <li>permissible uses of General Election Legal and Accounting Compliance (GELAC) funds\n        consistent with BCRA, </li>\n      <li>Quarterly and Monthly Reporting Requirements for presidential candidates,</li>\n      <li>several specific issues related to expenditures by campaigns, including salaries to\n        candidates, gifts and bonuses, and press reimbursement for travel costs,</li>\n      <li>mitigating the effect of a potential shortfall in the presidential primary matching\n        payment account,</li>\n      <li>expenditures by a multi-candidate political committee for qualified campaign expenses of\n        a presidential candidate.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" checked=\"false\" colspan=\"3\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "20030530hearing.html", "date": "05/30/2003", "pdf": null, "title": "Schedule Set for June 6 Public Hearing on Presidential Public Financing Proposed Rule", "category": "Hearings"}
