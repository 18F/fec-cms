The Committee agreed to pay the civil penalty, develop a compliance manual and to attend an FEC reporting seminar.</p>\n      <p>In ADR 319, Lewis for Senate, Inc., and its treasurer paid a $1,500 civil penalty for an inadvertent reporting violation.&#160; Respondents failed to disclose two disbursements on their 2005 July Quarterly Report.&#160; Respondents agreed to pay the civil penalty and work with Commission staff to terminate the committee.&#160; </p>\n      <p>In ADR 324, the Democratic Executive Committee of Florida and its treasurer acknowledged their failure to disclose all outstanding debt on their 2005 July Monthly Report.&#160; The Respondents amended the report in question, disclosed all outstanding debt and agreed to take steps to ensure timely and accurate disclosure of all debts and obligations in the future.&#160; </p>\n      <p>In ADR 334, Bruderly for Congress and its treasurer acknowledged reporting violations in their 2004 Post-General and 2004 Year End Reports.&#160; Three disbursements disclosed in those reports did not include an adequate description of purpose.&#160; Respondents agreed to work with FEC staff to correct those deficiencies in their reports.&#160; </p>\n      <p>ADR 349 arose from a complaint filed with the Commission alleging that the McCloskey for Congress Committee violated the disclaimer provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA/ the Act).&#160; Respondents acknowledged preparing 10,000 door-hangers without a proper disclaimer, and distributing 1,000 of those door-hangers before the error was discovered.&#160; &#160;The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion, dismissed the matter and closed the file.</p>\n      <p>ADR 354 arose from a complaint filed with the Commission alleging that the Tom Hayhurst for Congress Committee, its treasurer, and the candidate used fraudulent disclaimers on campaign materials.&#160; The Commission determined that the disclaimers in question complied with the requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), dismissed the matter and closed the file.</p>\n      <p>The FEC&#8217;s innovative ADR program has proven very effective at quickly resolving basic violations and reducing the agency&#8217;s costs for resolving enforcement matters. &#160;Since its inception on October 2, 2000, the ADR program has resolved 290 cases.</p>\n      <p>The ADR process is designed to reach an expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is in compliance with the Act.&#160; For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is being resolved and participate in mediation, if necessary.&#160; Resolutions are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval.&#160; Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available on the FEC&#8217;s web site and through the Public Records office.</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"36\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1/2.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"147\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=304&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">ADRs 304 &amp;
