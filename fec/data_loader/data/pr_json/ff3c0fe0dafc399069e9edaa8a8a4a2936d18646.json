Mr. King may, either individually or through a charitable foundation, make a charitable donation to encourage or commemorate a musician or performer&#8217;s volunteer efforts on behalf of a candidate or political committee.&#160; The FEC concluded that Mr. King&#8217;s charitable donations would be neither contributions to the campaigns and political committees nor compensation to the performers.&#160; The FEC also concluded that Mr. King may publicize his activities in connection with his program without making a contribution or expenditure.</p>\n              <p>The Commission also approved by a vote of 5-0 a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend FEC regulations to add to the list of permissible uses of campaign funds donations to non-Federal candidates and disbursements made for &#8220;any other lawful purpose&#8221; not already described in the regulations as a &#8220;personal use.&#8221;&#160; This amendment would conform Commission regulations to amendments recently made by Congress to the Federal Election Campaign Act. The NPRM will be published in the Federal Register, and a thirty-day public comment period will follow.</p>\n              <p>The Commission unanimously approved a Final Audit Report for the DeMint for Senate Committee, Inc.&#8217;s 2004 South Carolina Senate campaign.&#160; The proposed Report was modified after the Commission determined that the DeMint Committee was not obligated to file 48-Hour Notice reports in connection with a run-off election for contributions received the day preceding, and the day of, the primary election, but which were subsequently used for a run-off primary election.&#160; The Commission concluded that the Committee could not have known whether a run-off election would be required at the time the contributions in question were received and therefore was not required to file the special notices.&#160; </p>\n              <p>Finally, the FEC carried over its consideration of the Final Audit Report on Ted Poe for Congress&#8217; 2004 House campaign in Texas&#8217; 2nd Congressional district.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
