Publicly available information raised several questions as to whether the Mellon Trust loan constituted an excessive or prohibited contribution and whether the loan was accurately reported.&#160; In order to obtain the information necessary to resolve these questions, the Commission found reason to believe that the Committee and Mellon Trust Bank may have violated the law. Information obtained from the Respondents established that Senator Kerry did not borrow in excess of his share of the collateral property; that the Mellon Trust loan was a standard loan product offered to a number of other customers during the relevant time period and the Committee&#8217;s reporting of the loan in most respects accurately reflected the flow of funds from the bank to Senator Kerry and from Senator Kerry to the Committee. The Commission decided to take no further action against the Committee and Mellon Trust and find no reason to believe Teresa Heinz Kerry violated the law and close the file. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5421 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>2.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5560&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5560</a> </strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Case for Congress, James H.

The complaint attached an article from the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, regarding a settlement between the KFC entities and the Hawaiian Campaign Spending Commission (HCSC) that the KFC entities had made contributions that were both excessive and in the name of another to a number of campaigns, including U.S. Rep. Ed Case. In response, the Committee&#8217;s treasurer stated that he contacted the executive director of the HCSC, who told him the case referenced in the news article involved Case&#8217;s 2002 gubernatorial campaign. Also, the KFC entities stated that the alleged contributions concerned Case&#8217;s gubernatorial campaign in 2002 and not the Congressional campaign. In addition, the complaint alleged that contributions to the Committee from Stephen M. Case, and from other Maui personnel, were actually corporate contributions. None of these contributions exceeded $2,000 and the response from Maui asserted that each of these contributions was made from personal funds.&#160; Also, public records show that Phoenix and North Hawaii are both registered as LLCs, not corporations. The Committee stated that it complied with the reporting and accounting requirements for cash and anonymous cash contributions. The Commission found no reason to believe any of the respondents violated the law and closed the file.\n              <p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5560 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.
