The new page also provides guidance on the processes and procedures of the Reports Analysis Division (RAD), which helps with the accurate and timely disclosure of campaign finance activity, and reviews financial disclosure reports submitted to the Commission.&#160; </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>&#8220;As we enter this presidential election year, the Reports Analysis Division web page will be a vitally important, &#8216;one-stop&#8217; resource for political committees. I would like to thank the members of the Reports Analysis Division and the Office of Chief Information Officer, who worked collaboratively on this new page,&#8221; said Chair Caroline C. Hunter. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>The RAD web page released at <strong>http://www.fec.gov/rad/ </strong>provides the following: </p>\n        <p/>\n        <ul>\n          <li>an overview of the RAD review process;</li>\n          <li>a series of frequently asked questions (FAQs) targeted to candidate and party committees, PACs, and other filers;</li>\n          <li>links to filing information such as reporting schedules, electronic filing instructions, registration and reporting forms, and a link to information on upcoming training sessions and conferences;</li>\n          <li>links to filing resources for each type of committee such as campaign guides, independent expenditure timeframes, Federal Election Activity timeframes and coordinated expenditure limits; </li>\n          <li>tips on how to properly respond to Requests for Additional Information (RFAIs), covering topics such as adequate descriptions of purposes of disbursement and how to establish &#8220;best efforts&#8221; for obtaining contributor information;</li>\n          <li>links to the Commission&#8217;s Administrative Fine Program page and the Administrative Fine Calculator for late-filed reports;</li>\n          <li>users&#8217; manuals on the FECFile software program, and instructions on requesting a password for electronic filing; and</li>\n          <li>links to campaign finance reports, RFAIs, and miscellaneous documents filed by committees.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p/>\n        <p>In the coming weeks, committees will be able to use this web page to find contact information for their RAD campaign finance analysts.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>The Commission on Thursday also announced that it is now beginning to provide to respondents, in writing, the method used to determine the Commission&#8217;s opening settlement offer at the conciliation stage of certain enforcement matters. This information will be included with the proposed conciliation agreement.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>These newest initiatives are part of the Commission&#8217;s ongoing efforts to make its processes more transparent, including the following:</p>\n        <p/>\n        <ul>\n          <li><a href=\"../../law/cfr/ej_compilation/2011/notice_2011-15.pdf\">Agency Procedure Following the Submission of Probable Cause Briefs by the Office of General Counsel</a>, 76 Fed.
