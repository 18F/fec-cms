The Commission will certify an amount to be paid by the U.S. Treasury the following month. Only contributions from individuals in amounts of no more than $250 are matchable. Following the primary season, candidates may be entitled to receive additional matching funds to assist in winding down their campaigns or to retire debts. The maximum amount a candidate could receive is currently estimated to be about $21 million.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>\n              <p> The U.S. Treasury Department may pay the FEC-certified amounts beginning in January 2008.&#160;  Treasury Department regulations require that funds for the convention and general election grants be set aside before any matching fund payments are made.&#160; Information provided by the Treasury Department shows the balance in the fund as of November 30, 2007 was $166,233,140 and the Commission has estimated that no funds will be available for matching payments in January 2008.&#160; As deposits are made from tax returns in the early months of 2008, matching fund payments will be made from those deposits until all certified amounts have been paid.&#160; Based on historical patterns, the FEC estimates that funds may not be available to disburse before March 2008. </p>\n              <p> The Presidential public funding program is financed through the $3 check-off that appears on individual income tax returns.&#160; The program has three elements: grants to parties to help fund their nominating conventions, grants available to nominees to pay for the general election campaign, and matching payments to participating candidates during the primary campaign. </p>\n              <p> In June of this year the Commission certified $16,356,000 each to the Democratic and Republican parties for their conventions.&#160; The Commission estimates that each general election nominee will be eligible for a grant of approximately $85 million.&#160; </p>\n              <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
