The complaint also stated that the Nader committee shared a staff member, facilities and equipment without compensation. Mr. Nader responded that it leased half the office space but paid slightly more than half the rent, it received no rent subsidy from Citizen Works.&#160; The response stated that the committee paid for its own computers, office supplies, internet connection, facsimile telecopier and provided a telephone bill that it paid for the telephone line. Because the response refutes the complaint&#8217;s allegations the Commission found no reason to believe that the respondents violated the Act. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\"><p>Documents from these matters are available from the \n              Commission's web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering \n              5475 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.

The complaints cite newspaper articles which report that various individuals coordinated an effort by national party lawyers to challenge Nader ballot petitions in various states. The Respondents responses focused on the insufficiency of evidence in the allegations. The Commission, given the lack of specificity of the complaint, found no reason to believe that the respondents violated the Act with regard to the use of public funds. The Commission has no jurisdiction in the area of civil rights violations, thus no findings are warranted. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td><p>Documents from these matters are available from the Commission's web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5509 under the case number in the Enforcement Query System.

The Swift Boat Vets amended all of its electioneering communications reports and changed its designation to an unincorporated organization. The Swift Boat Vets response stated that the original designation was inadvertent. A search of public records confirms the Swift Boat Vets has not been incorporated, therefore the Commission found there was no reason to believe the respondents violated the Act. </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td><p>Documents from these matters are available from the Commission's web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5565 under the case number in the Enforcement Query System.
