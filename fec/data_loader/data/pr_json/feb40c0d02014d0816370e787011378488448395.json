If sent by certified or registered mail, the report must have been postmarked by July 19, 2006.&#160; The Committee filed a standard July quarterly report covering April 1, 2006 through June 30, 2006 but failed to provide information as required for the first two weeks of July.</p>\n<p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports even though their names may appear on state ballots. If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n<p>The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of these filing requirements on June 28, 2006. Those committees that did not file on the due date were notified on July 24, 2006 that reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n<p>Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions against non-filers, and the FEC has implemented a new administrative fine program that can subject committees to penalties ranging from $30 to $16,000 or more. </p>\n<p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for Tennessee candidate committees will be the October Quarterly Report, due October 15. It will cover activity from July 15 through September 30.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"># # #</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p align=\"center\">&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n</body>\n", "href": "press2006/20060801nf.html", "date": "08/01/2006", "pdf": null, "title": "Campaign Fails to File Pre-Primary Report in Tennessee", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
