Chagnon in the 7th Congressional District, and Robert J. Harms in the 4th Congressional District were cited by the Federal Election Commission today for failing to file financial disclosure reports required by the Federal Election Campaign Act (&#8220;the Act&#8221;). </p>\n<p>Florida is holding its primary election for federal candidates on September 5. The Act requires committees supporting candidates in the primary to file reports of their financial activity 12 days before the election.</p>\n<p>As of 5 p.m., August 31, 2006 a disclosure report from the following committee had not been filed:</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><u>State </u></p></td>\n    <td width=\"330\" valign=\"top\"><p><u>Committee</u></p></td>\n    <td width=\"195\" valign=\"top\"><p><u>Treasurer</u></p></td>\n    <td width=\"195\" valign=\"top\"><p><u>Candidate </u></p></td>\n    <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><u>Party</u></p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>FL</strong></p></td>\n    <td width=\"330\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>NEREE FOR U.

If sent by certified or registered mail, the report must have been postmarked by August 21, 2006.&#160; </p>\n<p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports even though their names may appear on state ballots. If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n<p>The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of these filing requirements on July 31, 2006. Those committees that did not file on the due date were notified on August 25, 2006 that reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n<p>Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions against non-filers, and the FEC has implemented a new administrative fine program that can subject committees to penalties ranging from $30 to $16,000 or more. </p>\n<p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for Florida candidate committees will be the October Quarterly Report, due October 15. It will cover activity from August 17 through September 30.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"># # #</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n</body>\n", "href": "press2006/20060901nf.html", "date": "09/01/2006", "pdf": null, "title": "Campaigns Fail to File Pre-Primary Reports in Florida", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
