This brings to 187 \n        the total number of cases released since the ADR program began October \n        2, 2000. The program's goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement \n        matters, reduce the cost of processing complaints, and enhance overall \n        FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available \n        in the FEC's Press and Public Records offices. </span></p>\n      <p align=\"left\"> <span>For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent \n        must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside \n        the statute of limitations while the case is pending in the ADR Office, \n        and agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if necessary, \n        mediation.</span></p>\n      <p align=\"left\"><span>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching \n        an expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both \n        satisfying to the respondent(s) and in compliance with the Federal Election \n        Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions reached through direct and, when necessary, \n        mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval. \n        If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds \n        by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved \n        through ADR are not precedential.</span></p></td></tr>\n        <tr><td colspan=\"3\">\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\"><b>1.</b></td>\n          <td width=\"9%\" valign=\"top\"><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=242&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">ADR 242</a> </strong></td>\n          <td width=\"90%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"9%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"90%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"9%\" valign=\"top\"><b>RESPONDENTS:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"90%\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a) Capri Cafaro for Congress (OH/14), Ronald &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Silvestri, treasurer</p>\n          (b) Renee Cafaro\n          <p>&#160; </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"9%\" valign=\"top\"><b>SOURCE:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"90%\" valign=\"top\"> MUR 5510: Donald F.

The Committee contends that as the checks had not cleared the bank, the disbursements were overlooked in preparing the report. Respondents contend that procedures have been put in place in an effort to avoid similar errors in the future, such as changed filing frequency to monthly to improve reporting and ensure timely receipt, established additional bank depository for contributions, retained FEC reporting consultant to confirm bank reconciliation, and prepare FEC reports to ensure compliance with FECA.
