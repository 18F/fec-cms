Specific improvements found in the analysis include:</p>\n      <div align=\"left\">\n        <ul>\n          <li>Substantial growth in total civil penalties collected in recent years, reaching more than $3 million in FY2004;</li>\n            <li>Large reductions in the time required to complete most enforcement actions;</li>\n            <li>A six fold increase in the number of actions for reporting violations including more than 1,000 administrative fines assessed for late filing; and</li>\n            <li>Increased use of non-financial solutions for some compliance problems, emphasizing training, policy changes by committees and independent audits aimed at reducing future violations.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>      \n      <p align=\"left\">The FEC&#8217;s budget summary concludes that &#8220;[t]o continue reaping the benefits of automation in our disclosure and compliance programs without adding additional staff, it is imperative that the Commission receive the requested resources in FY2006 to implement the automated review of financial disclosure reports, to continue to enhance the analysis and accessibility of campaign finance disclosure information, and to improve the timeliness and salience of enforcement and to continue the alternative compliance programs.&#8221;</p>\n      <p align=\"left\"/>\n      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Budget materials submitted to Congress can be found at <a href=\"../../pages/budget/budget.shtml\">http://www.fec.gov/pages/budget/budget.shtml</a></p>\n      <p/>\n      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The FEC&#8217;s Enforcement Profile is available at <a href=\"../../pages/budget/fy2006/cbr2006/cbr_app_d.pdf\">http://www.fec.gov/pages/budget/fy2006/cbr2006/cbr_app_d.pdf</a></p>\n      <p/>\n      <p/>\n      <p align=\"center\">#&#160;&#160; #&#160;&#160; #</p>\n      <p/>      <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      <div align=\"left\">\n        <blockquote> \n          <blockquote>&#160; \n          </blockquote>\n        </blockquote>\n      </div>      <blockquote><blockquote><p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n        </blockquote>\n      </blockquote>\n      <div align=\"left\">\n        <blockquote>&#160; \n        </blockquote>\n      </div>      <blockquote><p align=\"left\"><strong>&#160; </strong></p>\n        <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n        <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <div align=\"left\"><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"/>          <blockquote>&#160; \n          </blockquote>\n      </div>\n      <blockquote><p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n    </blockquote></th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th valign=\"top\" colspan=\"3\" height=\"34\">&#160;</th>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "press2005/20050412budget.html", "date": "04/12/2005", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Submits FY 2006 Budget Request of $54.6 Million", "category": "Other Agency Actions"}
