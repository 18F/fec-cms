Sharpton in which he agreed to repay, with interest, the $100,000 in public funds he had received in 2004 under the Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act (Matching Fund Act).      </p>\n      </div>\n      <p align=\"left\">To be eligible to receive Federal Matching Funds, a candidate must first raise $100,000 in contributions from individuals by raising in excess of $5,000 in each of at least 20 states. &#160;&#160;Candidates must also agree to abide by spending limits as well as limiting spending from personal funds to $50,000. Once they have established eligibility, candidates may receive public funds to match contributions from individuals up to $250 per individual.</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">On January 2, 2004, Rev. Alfred C. Sharpton applied for matching fund payment under the Matching Payment Act in which he certified that he had not and would not exceed the $50,000 limitation on the use of his personal funds. The Commission certified that his committee was eligible to receive an initial $100,000 in matching funds on March 11, 2004.&#160; On March 20, 2004 the committee filed a disclosure report containing information indicating that the candidate exceeded the $50,000 personal expenditure limitation. Therefore, the Commission suspended further matching fund payments to his committee. On April 28, 2005, following an administrative review, the Commission made a determination that Rev. Sharpton should repay the $100,000 plus interest. </p>\n      <p align=\"left\">According to the repayment agreement, Rev. Sharpton agreed to a repayment schedule consisting of four payments beginning with $25,000 on November 9, 2005 followed by three more payments of $25,000 each plus interest on December 10, 2005, January 10, 2006 and February 10, 2006.</p>\n      <p/>\n    <p align=\"center\">###</p></th>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n"}
