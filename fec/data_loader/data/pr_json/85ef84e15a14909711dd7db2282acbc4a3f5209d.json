In a joint response, KFI AM-640, John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou asserted that KFI AM-640&#8217;s broadcasts of the show fall within the legitimate press function of a <em>bona fide</em> media entity, and are entitled to the Act&#8217;s media exemption. A joint response from Cynthia Matthews and the Committee denies coordination with the station with regard to the station&#8217;s programming. The Commission found no reason to believe that the respondents violated the Act in this matter and closed the case. Statement of Reasons were issued by Chairman Toner and Commissioners Mason and von Spakovsky. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5569under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p>&#160;</p>\n          </td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>2.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5578&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>MUR 5578</strong></a><strong> </strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; STF Productions, Inc.

The complaint asserted that &#8220;America&#8217;s Most Wanted&#8221; is a corporate asset and the name is a protected trademark owned by STF and by using the name in the commercial and by &#8220;mimic[king] the tone and feel of the show,&#8221; the Committee improperly benefited from the value of the show&#8217;s trademarked name and goodwill and that this amounted to a prohibited corporate contribution.&#160; &#160;Respondents argue that the reference to &#8220;America&#8217;s Most Wanted&#8221; does not constitute a prohibited corporate contribution and was used simply to identify Walsh to the audience. According to respondents, Walsh endorsed Wetterling in an individual capacity and volunteered his services for the commercial. STF and Wetterling responded that neither STF, Fox or any affilitated company endorsed Wetterling and that the Committee paid for all expenses associated with the advertisement. The advertisement does not display STF&#8217;s trademark or mimic the tone and feel of the show. The lack of corporate endorsement and the appearance of a personal message contained in the advertisement suggest that Walsh appeared in his individual capacity. According to respondents, Walsh and the candidate are long-time friends and STF initially did not know that the advertisement would identify Walsh as the host of the show. Because the Committee never used the trademarked logo in the advertisement, paid all expenses, did not include or suggest a corporate endorsement and Walsh appeared in his individual capacity, the Commission found no reason to believe there was a corporate contribution. Also, the Commission found no reason to believe that Wetterling and the Committee may have solicited, directed, transferred, or spend corporate funds. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering  5578 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>3.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5582&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>MUR 5582</strong></a><strong> </strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Abercrombie for Congress (HI/02), Jack Y.

The complainant surmises that since these individuals violated state campaign laws by making excessive contributions and contributions in the names of others to state political committees, it is possible that they made the same types of Federal contributions to the Respondents. Respondents admit accepting contributions from the individuals named in the complaint, but argue that the contributions are not excessive or prohibited. Respondents also insist that all of the complainant&#8217;s allegations are speculative, and that the information in the complaint offers no independent basis for investigation. Since the complainant offered no facts or specific information, and that the allegations were based solely on the Committee&#8217;s acceptance of contributions (which were within the limits of the Act) from individuals who were sanctioned by the State for violating State campaign laws, the Commission found no reason to believe there was a violation of the Act and closed the case. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5582 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>4.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5631&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>MUR 5631</strong></a><strong> </strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> Alcona County Republican Party (ACRC) </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> Mark Brewer  </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> In-kind contribution, disclaimers, failure to report independent expenditure  </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>DISPOSITION:</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>No reason to believe, but took no further action*</p>\n            <p>[re: in-kind contribution]</p>\n            <p>Dismiss the allegations and close the file*</p>\n            <p>[re: disclaimers; failure to report independent expenditure]</p>\n            <p/>\n          The complaint alleged that the ACRC violated the Act by placing political advertisements in the <em>Alcona County Review</em>. The complaint further stated that the advertisements constituted improper in-kind contributions to Bush-Cheney &#8217;04 as well as Don Hooper and Richard Fortier, Republican candidates for congress; failed to include an appropriate disclaimer; and failed to properly report the expenditures for the advertisement as required. In its response, ACRC denies that if failed to include proper disclaimers in its political advertisements. In addition, although it did not deny the remaining allegations in the complaint, they claim that due to their limited membership and financial activity, it is exempt from election reporting requirements. Since the complaint lacks specific allegation the Commission found no reason to believe the ACRC violated the Act by making an in-kind contribution to either Bush-Cheney &#8217;04 or Don Hooper for Congress. The Commission decided to exercise its prosecutorial discretion and dismiss the remaining allegations due to the modest amount paid for the advertisement and ACRC&#8217;s limited resources and federal activity. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5631 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>5.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5555&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>MUR 5665</strong></a><strong> </strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Take Back the House (TBTH), M.

The referral provided the basis for the Commission&#8217;s finding reason to believe that TBTH accepted a $5,000 excessive contribution, a $20,000 corporate contribution from AT&amp;T, a $25,000 contribution from a labor organization and a $2,500 contribution from a nonfederal committee that lacked sufficient federal funds to make a contribution. AT&amp;T responded to the Commission&#8217;s findings by providing documentary evidence indicating that it made a corporate contribution to TBTH based upon the misconception that TBTH was a nonfederal committee and TBTH&#8217;s assurances that it could lawfully accept corporate contributions. The Commission conciliated with both Take Back the House and Interactive Digital Software Association. The Commission found reason to believe with regard to AT&amp;T Corporation but decided to take no further action. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5665 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>6.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5673&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>MUR 5673</strong></a><strong> </strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Sandy Lyons for Congress (NC/10), Melissa B.

According to commission disclosure records, Lyons made a series of contributions to his Committee from his personal funds between January 6 and August 31, 2004, all designated to the primary election. As expenditures from Lyons&#8217; personal funds exceeded the $350,000 aggregate threshold on July 9, 2004, the FEC Form 10 was due no later than July 10, however the Commission did not received Lyons&#8217; FEC Form 10 until July 14, 2004, four days after the deadline. The Commission conciliated with the respondents and closed the case. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5673 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>      \n      <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      <b>\n</b><p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n<b>\n</b><p>*There are four administrative stages to the FEC enforcement process:</p>\n      \n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"70%\">\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"50%\"><b>1.
