Mr. Carney responded that his firm (Norwich Hill Associates) was hired by individuals to conduct ballot access activities on behalf of Ralph Nader for President. The Nader Committee responded that it accepted the services of David Carney to circulate petitions, but assumed Carney was a volunteer using his own time to assist the campaign. The Nader Committee was unaware that \n\n\nDavid Carney had hired Norway Hill, and in fact when Norway Hill&#8217;s involvement came to light, the Nader Committee did what it could to remedy the situation. Choices for America&#8217;s response stated that they had no connection to David Carney or Norway Hill Associates. The Committee&#8217;s counsel and campaign manager contacted Carney, requested an accounting of Norway Hill&#8217;s expenses, and paid for the outstanding amount. The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and decided to dismiss the matter against the Nader Committee, Norway Hill and the three individuals. The Commission, based on the information, found no reason to believe that Choices for America violated the Act. Statements of Reasons were issued by Chairman Thomas, Vice Chairman Toner and Commissioners McDonald, Mason, Toner and Weintraub. </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering  5513 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>3.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5533&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5533 </a></strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Nader for President 2004, Carl M.

MSRCC does not contest that the amounts spent for its petition gathering effort were expenditures, but stated that it paid for these costs from its Federal Account and reported them as such to the Commission. The party also stated that because the expenditures were not coordinated with the Nader Committee, the costs could not be contributions and were independent expenditures. The Nader committee said they took extraordinary steps to distance itself from the Republican signature gathering and undertook no measures to adopt any signatures gathered by Republican volunteers. The Nader Committee argues that it did not violate the Act because MRSCC&#8217;s activities appeared to have been voluntary and unpaid, and as such, would be exempt as contributions. The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and decided to dismiss the matter against the MRSCC, its treasurer and Nader&#8217;s committee and its treasurer. The Commission found no reason to believe with regard to Greg McNeilly. Statements of Reasons were issued by Chairman Thomas, Vice Chairman Toner and Commissioners McDonald, Mason, Smith and Weintraub. </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering  5533 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>      \n      <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      <b>\n</b><p>*There are four administrative stages to the FEC enforcement process:</p>\n    \n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"70%\">\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"50%\"><b>1.
