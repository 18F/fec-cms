GARRETT, TREAS...GRANT G. GARRETT...REP</p>\n\n<p>MI/10...T. TURNER FOR U S CONGRESS...THOMAS TURNER, TREAS...THOMAS A. TURNER...REP</p></font><font face=\"Book Antiqua\" size=\"3\">\n\n<p>The reports were to include financial activity occurring from July 1 through July 19.\nIf sent by certified or registered mail, the reports should have been postmarked by July\n24. Otherwise, the due date was close-of-business July 27.</p>\n\n<p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal\nelection law, even though their names may appear on state ballots. If an individual raises\nor spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to\nreporting under the FECA.</p>\n\n<p>The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential filing\nrequirements on <b>July 3</b>. Those committees which did not file on the due date were\nnotified on <b>July 28</b> that reports had not been received and that their names would\nbe published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n\n<p>Other political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those\nwhich are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to file\npre-primary reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names are not published\nby the FEC.</p>\n\n<p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a\ncase-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement\nactions, including the imposition of civil penalties ($5,500 for \"any violation\"\nand $11,000 for any \"knowing and willful\" violation).</p>\n\n<p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees will be the\nquarterly report, due October 15. It will cover activity from July 20 through September\n30.</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\">&#160;</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></font>\n</body>\n"}
