By way of comparison, in 1993, the last election cycle for\nthe present group of 33 Senate seats, 50 candidates reported raising $25 million and\nspending $7 million. In 1995, 49 candidates raised $24 million and spent $10 million. In\n1997, 58 Senate candidates raised $42.6 million and spent $10.8 million.</p>\n\n<p>From January 1 through June 30, 1999, contributions from individuals accounted for\n$34.5 million, or 69% of the total raised by Senate candidates. PAC money totaled $10.7\nmillion and represented 21.4% of receipts.</p>\n\n<p>Candidates began the second half of the non-election year with $60.9 million cash on\nhand and debts of $6.3 million, which may relate to previous elections.</p>\n\n<p>The attached pages provide summary statistical information on each candidate. Financial\nactivity for 1995-96 and 1997-98 is also included, where available. The next reports for\nSenate campaigns are due January 31, 2000, and will cover the last six months of 1999. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"../2000/state20.htm\">View Candidate Summaries by State</a></p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n</font>\n</body>\n", "date": "09/22/1999", "href": "senmy99.htm", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries", "title": "FEC Releases 6-Month Senate Fundraising Figures", "pdf": null}
