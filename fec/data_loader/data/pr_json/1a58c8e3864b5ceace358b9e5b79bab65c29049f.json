Morse (MA/04)), violated the Act&#8217;s reporting and disclaimer requirements when it failed to disclose that a portion of a public communication had been paid in the form of an in-kind contribution from the candidate personally.&#160; Also, the disclaimer on that communication did not comply with the Act&#8217;s requirements.&#160; Additionally, Morse for Congress 2004 failed to comply with the Act&#8217;s electronic filing requirements.&#160; Morse for Congress 2004 agreed to pay a $9,000 civil penalty.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5612, the Commission found no reason to believe Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Service Employees International Political Education &amp; Action Fund (SEIU IPEA), America Coming Together (ACT) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) violated the Act.&#160; The complaint centered on allegations that SEIU and SEIU IPEA made prohibited contributions to ACT and the DNC.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5789, the Commission found no reason to believe Bacardi, Inc. violated the Act by facilitating the making of contributions.&#160; The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and declined to pursue allegations that Bacardi failed to obtain advance payment from its political action committee (PAC) for catering expenses for a Bacardi PAC fundraising event.&#160; The Commission sent Bacardi a letter instructing it to obtain advance payments for these events in the future. The Commission also found no reason to believe that Martinez for Senate, the principal campaign committee of Mel Martinez (FL), or Bill Nelson for U.S. Senate, the principal campaign committee of Bill Nelson (FL), knowingly accepted corporate contributions.&#160; The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and declined to pursue allegations that the Martinez Committee failed to provide employer information for certain contributors, but notified the committee that it should take steps to prevent similar mistakes in the future.&#160; </p>\n              <p>In MUR 5844, the Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and declined to pursue allegations that then-Congressman Jim Gibbons (NV/02) violated the Act when his state political action committee, Silver State Leadership Fund (the Fund), accepted corporate contributions.&#160; The Respondents maintained that four contributions in question were received prior to the effective date of BCRA or were from permissible sources.&#160; With respect to a fifth contribution, the Commission admonished Gibbons and the Fund and required the Fund to refund $2,000 to the donor. </p>\n              <p>In MUR 5773, the Commission dismissed allegations that Denunzio for Congress, the principal campaign committee of Michael Anthony DeNunzio (CA/08), failed to use adequate disclaimers on mailed solicitations.&#160; The Commission also dismissed allegations that Citizens for a Better San Francisco and Republicans United for San Francisco failed to report funds raised in support of the DeNunzio campaign.</p>\n              <p>Five enforcement cases involved candidate debates.&#160; In MURs 5827 and 5829, complainants alleged Resodyn Corporation, along with the <em>Montana Standard</em> newspaper, made a prohibited in-kind contribution to Friends of Conrad Burns &#8211; 2006, the principal campaign committee of Conrad Burns (MT), by structuring a debate to ensure that Burns supporters were given prominent, visible seating.&#160; The Commission dismissed the allegations after determining the matters did not warrant further review based on Enforcement Priority System criteria.**</p>\n              <p>In MURs 5836, 5858, and 5863, Congressional candidate Phil Maymin (CT/04), Senate candidate Richard Mack (AZ), and Congressional candidate James Hurysz (VA/08), alleged they were improperly excluded from debates held in their respective Congressional districts or states.&#160; The Commission dismissed the allegations after determining each matter did not warrant further review based on Enforcement Priority System criteria.**</p>\n              <p>By law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases or Matters Under Review (MURs) through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the FEC and the individual or group the Commission determines has violated the law.&#160;

The MSDCC made the first disbursement for the advertisement in August 2005 and made three related disbursements during October and November of that year.&#160; The ad began airing in Montana on August 8, 2005.&#160; The MSDCC first disclosed the disbursements made in connection with &#8220;Smell Test&#8221; on its 2005 Year End Report.&#160; The FEC concluded that the &#8220;Smell Test&#8221; advertisement constituted FEA and as a result the MSDCC should have filed monthly reports.</p>\n                      <p>The MSDCC&#8217;s executive director, Jim Farrell, received a salary paid entirely from the Committee&#8217;s non-federal account.&#160;

</p>\n                      <p>According to Bacardi, its PAC held the event in a meeting room that the company regularly makes available to community civic and educational organizations at no charge, serving limited refreshments and food provided by Bacardi&#8217;s in-house caterers.&#160; Bacardi also asserted that two employees who volunteered their time to the Martinez campaign planned the fundraiser and extended no more than 25 invitations to personal and business contacts.</p>\n                      <p>In September of 2005, the Bacardi PAC held a fundraiser for Bill Nelson for U.S. Senate.&#160; The complaint asserted Bacardi used a corporate list of vendors to distribute invitations to the fundraiser and solicit contributions from employees of those vendors.&#160; Bacardi denied the maintenance of a list of corporate vendors or use of such list to distribute fundraiser invitations.</p>\n                      <p>The Commission found no reason to believe Bacardi violated the Act by facilitating the making of contributions, dismissed allegations that Bacardi failed to obtain pre-payment from its PAC for catering expense and admonished Bacardi to ensure that it obtains pre-payment for catering expenses for future Bacardi PAC fundraising events.&#160; The FEC found no reason to believe that Bacardi PAC violated the Act.&#160; The Commission found no reason to believe Martinez for Senate or Bill Nelson for U.S. Senate knowingly accepted corporate contributions.&#160; The Commission dismissed allegations that the Martinez Committee failed to provide employer information for certain contributors and admonished them to prevent future similar mistakes.&#160; </p>\n                      <p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n                      <p><strong/></p>\n                      <p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5789 under case numbers in the Enforcement Query System.
