Associates of Little Rock Arkansas (the Firm), and Edwards for President (the principal campaign committee of John Edwards&#8217; 2004 campaign) have agreed to pay a total of $59,500 in civil penalties for violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act) and FEC regulations over prohibited corporate contributions and making contributions in the name of another.</p>\n      <p>In January 2003, Mr. Turner hosted two fundraisers in Arkansas to benefit John Edwards&#8217; presidential campaign.&#160; Mr. Turner&#8217;s assistant at the Firm worked with Edwards for President to plan the fundraisers.&#160; This assistant and other Firm employees contacted potential contributors, collected and forwarded contributions and prepared fundraising invitations.&#160; All these activities were performed during normal work hours and as part of the employees&#8217; job duties.&#160; Mr. Turner also had his assistant solicit four Firm employees to make $2,000 contributions to the Edwards Committee and to then reimburse them through the Firm.&#160; The night of the fundraisers, Mr. Turner used the Firm&#8217;s credit card to contribute $2,000 to the Edwards Committee and make a $2,000 contribution attributed to his brother and sister-in-law.&#160; He also charged $2,357.88 in hotel and rental car expenses to the Firm for Edwards Committee staffers&#8217; travel to the fundraisers.</p>\n      <p>Mr. Turner and his incorporated law firm, Turner and Associates, P.A., violated the Act by making contributions in the name of another with corporate funds, making prohibited corporate in-kind contributions and using corporate resources to facilitate contributions to Edwards for President.&#160; Mr. Turner and the Firm will pay a $50,000 civil penalty.&#160; </p>\n      <p>Edwards for President admitted it violated the Act by accepting prohibited in-kind contributions from Turner and Associates.&#160; Edwards for President also violated the Act by accepting a contribution made by Mr. Turner in the name of his brother and sister-in-law.&#160; In order to settle the matter, Edwards for President will not further contest this finding and will pay a $9,500 civil penalty.</p>\n      <p>The FEC admonished Mr. Turner&#8217;s assistant, his brother and sister-in-law and the four Firm employees whose contributions were reimbursed.&#160; Finally, in situations unrelated to the facts described above, the FEC found no reason to believe respondents associated with the following law firms violated the Act: Howarth &amp; Smith; Robinson, Calcagnie &amp; Robinson; Shernoff, Bidart &amp; Darras, LLP; and Wilkes &amp; McHugh.</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p/>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"240\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5366&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR</a></strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5366&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong> 5366</strong></a></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"240\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"120\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"240\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a) Clyde Tab Turner</p>\n              <p>(b) Turner &amp;
