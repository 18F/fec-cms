If an individual raises or spends $5,000 or less, he or she is not  considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the Act. <br/>\n  <br/>\n          The Commission notified committees of their potential filing requirements on June  21, 2016. Those committees that did not file by the due date were sent  notification on July 22, 2016, that their reports had not been received and  that their names would be published if they did not respond within four  business days. <br/>\n  <br/>\n          Other political committees that support Senate and House candidates in  elections, but are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign, are also  required to file quarterly reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee  names are not published by the Commission. <br/>\n  <br/>\n          Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a  case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the Commission broad authority to  initiate enforcement actions, and the Commission has implemented an  Administrative Fine program with provisions for assessing monetary penalties.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <em><br/>\n    The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is  an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has  jurisdiction over the  financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives,  the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six  Commissioners who  are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S.  Senate.</em></p>\n        <p><br/>\n          #  # #<br/>\n        </p>\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>&#160;\n                </blockquote>\n              </blockquote>\n            </blockquote>\n          </blockquote>\n</blockquote></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>      \n      </div>\n      ", "date": "07/29/2016", "href": "press2016/news_releases/20160729release.shtml", "category": "Non-Filer Publications", "title": "FEC Cites Committees for Failure to File July Quarterly Financial Report", "pdf": null}
