OLSON, TREAS&#133;SUSAN GRIMES\nMUNSELL&#133;REP</b></font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\"><b>MI/15&#133;KILPATRICK\nFOR UNITED STATES CONGRESS&#133;ANTHONY D.

WRIGHT II&#133;DEM</b></font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The reports were to include\nfinancial activity occurring from July 1 through July 15. If sent\nby registered mail, the reports should have been postmarked by\nJuly 20. Otherwise, the due date was close-of-business July 23.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Some individuals and their\ncommittees have no obligation to file reports under federal\nelection law, even though their names may appear on state\nballots. If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he\nor she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to\nreporting under the FECA.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The FEC notified committees\ninvolved in the primary of their potential filing requirements on\nJune 29. Those committees which did not file on the due date were\nnotified on July 24 that reports had not been received and that\ntheir names would be published if they did not respond within\nfour business days.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Other political committees\nsupporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those which\nare not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are\nrequired to file pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly.\nThose committee names are not published by the FEC.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Further Commission action\nagainst non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case\nbasis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate\nenforcement actions, including the imposition of civil penalties\n($5,500 for \"any violation\" and $11,000 for any\n\"knowing and willful\" violation).</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The next regularly\nscheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees will be the\nquarterly report due October 15. It will cover activity from July\n16 through September 30.</font></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\"/>&#160;</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"2\"># # #</font></p>\n</body>\n", "href": "nonfilpp.htm", "date": "07/31/1998", "pdf": null, "title": "Campaigns Cited for Failure to File Pre-Primary Report", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
