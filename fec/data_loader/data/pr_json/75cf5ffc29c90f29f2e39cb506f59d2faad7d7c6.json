FEC</em>.     \n      </p><p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in this case on July 15, 2005 (<em>Shays v. FEC, No. 04-5352</em>).&#160;\n      </p><p>In a statement, FEC Chairman Scott Thomas said &#8220;the Commission will be taking a reasonable amount of time to analyze the impact of the recent D.C. Circuit opinion in <em>Shays v. FEC</em>.&#160; The agency needs to evaluate whether to seek any reconsideration or appeal and whether any particular rulemaking already in process is affected.&#160; The Commission intends to move as quickly as possible to prepare any regulation changes or clarifications required by the courts so that participants in the 2006 election cycle will have timely guidance.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n      <p>The next open meeting of the Commission is scheduled for August 11, 2005. </p>\n      <p>          \n      </p><p align=\"center\">### </p></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "date": "07/22/2005", "href": "press2005/20050722wirenotice.htm", "category": "Open Meetings and Related Matters", "title": "FEC Cancels July 28, 2005 Open Meeting", "pdf": null}
