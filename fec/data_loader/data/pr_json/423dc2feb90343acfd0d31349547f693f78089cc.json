Much of the independent expenditure activity during 2004 was undertaken by national political parties.&#160; The DNC spent $120 million on these independent expenditures, while the RNC spent $18.2 million.&#160; In addition, the RNC spent $45.8 million on generic media ads that included both specific campaign messages and generic party support messages for which they shared the cost of some advertising with the Bush campaign.&#160; DNC spending on similar ads totaled $24 million.&#160; The two national parties also spent $32.1 million in coordination with the 2004 presidential campaigns during the general election period.&#160; Each party was permitted to spend up to $16.25 million on this activity.&#160; In 2000 parties spent $27.2 million on coordinated expenditures, while the total in 1996 was $18.7 million.</p>\n      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Membership organizations reported $12.3 million in communications to their members advocating the election or defeat of a presidential candidate.&#160; This amount was little changed from the $11.5 million these organizations reported during the 2000 campaign.</p>\n      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Finally, in 2004 groups reported making electioneering communications totaling $40.8 million that made reference to presidential candidates.&#160; Electioneering communications are broadcast ads aired in the period just before an election that refer to federal candidates.</p>\n      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Additional tables attached to this release provide details about the <a href=\"presrec2004full.pdf\">sources of receipts</a> for presidential pre-nomination campaigns and <a href=\"presdisb2004full.pdf\">some information about how the money was spent</a>.&#160; Candidates seeking nominations raised $611.4 million in contributions directly from individuals, $28 million in federal matching funds, $3.5 million from PACs and $6.8 million in transfers from prior campaigns.&#160; 2004 was the first cycle in which both major party nominees declined public matching funds during the primaries, and<a href=\"fundhistory.pdf\"> the $28 million paid in those funds was the lowest total since the first presidential election conducted under the system in 1976</a>.&#160; The $269.6 million raised by President Bush prior to the convention was nearly three times his fundraising total in 2000, when he also declined to accept public funds.&#160; John Kerry raised $234.6 million, nearly six times more than had ever been raised by a Democratic nominee under the public funding program, which imposes spending limits on candidates who accept matching funds and limits the total amount of public funds available.</p>\n      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The extraordinary fundraising by the two nominees led to some disbursements that were also unusual for candidate committees.&#160; The Kerry primary committee, for example, <a href=\"kerrytoparty.pdf\">transferred more than $40 million to Democratic Party committees </a>at both the national and state levels, with $23.6 million going to the DNC.&#160; The Bush primary committee transferred $11.3 million to the RNC in mid October.</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p>Overview of Presidential Financial Activity 1996 - 2004 [<a href=\"presbigpic.xls\">excel</a>] [<a href=\"presbigpic.pdf\">pdf</a>] </p>\n      <p>2004 Presidential Primary Campaign Receipts [<a href=\"presrec2004full.xls\">excel</a>] [<a href=\"presrec2004full.pdf\">pdf</a>] </p>\n      <p>2004 Presidential Primary Campaign Disbursements [<a href=\"presdisb2004full.xls\">excel</a>] [<a href=\"presdisb2004full.pdf\">pdf</a>] </p>\n      <p>Presidential Public Funding History [<a href=\"fundhistory.xls\">excel</a>] [<a href=\"fundhistory.pdf\">pdf</a>] </p>\n      <p>Kerry Campaign Transfers to Parties [<a href=\"kerrytoparty.xls\">excel</a>] [<a href=\"kerrytoparty.pdf\">pdf</a>] </p>\n      <p align=\"center\">### </p>\n    <p>&#160;</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\" colspan=\"3\">&#160;</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "date": "02/03/2005", "href": "press2005/20050203pressum/20050203pressum.html", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries", "title": "2004 Presidential Campaign Finance Activity Summarized", "pdf": null}
