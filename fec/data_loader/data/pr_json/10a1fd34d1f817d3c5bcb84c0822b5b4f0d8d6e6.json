Under the Conciliation Agreement, the respondent agreed to pay a $300,000 civil penalty. In addition, the respondent agreed to transfer $562,538.75 to its member homeowners associations and $34,509 to ARDA-ROC, its connected organization. These amounts are equal to the stipulated amount of prohibited corporate and foreign national contributions received by the respondent from 2003 through 2007, less the $18,323 that the respondent already disgorged to the U.S. Treasury. </p></td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n        <p>Under the law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases, or MURs, through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group.
