They will be updated throughout the year with additional campaign finance-related topics in an effort to help the general public and political committees keep up with new developments in campaign finance laws and regulations.</p>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency.
