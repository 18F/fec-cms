The U.S. Treasury Department will make the payments \n    on January 2, 2004.<p>By comparison, in 2000, the first matching fund \n    payments went to eight candidates, totaling $34,019,496.24; in 1996, 10 \n    candidates received $37,353,967.40; in 1992, eight candidates received \n    $6,372,788.31; in 1988, 12 candidates received a total of $28,748,261.05; In \n    1984, $7,771,960.41 was paid to six candidates; in 1980, $1,944,055.92 was \n    paid to three candidates; and in 1976, 11 candidates received $1,880,502.21.</p>\n    <p>The following chart lists the amount certified to each candidate. While \n    the Fund contains sufficient funds to pay these certifications in full, \n    there may not be sufficient monies in the Fund to pay full certifications in \n    February. Reduced payments will continue until the Fund has been replenished \n    by future checkoff designations on 2003 tax returns, at which time each \n    campaign will receive the amount it is due. Howard Dean initially qualified \n    to receive matching funds, but his campaign withdrew its request for funds.\n    </p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"/>\n    <center>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n      <tr>\n        <th scope=\"col\" class=\"small\">CANDIDATE</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\" width=\"12\" class=\"small\">&#160;</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\" class=\"small\">CERTIFICATION<br/>\n        TODAY</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td colspan=\"3\"><hr/></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Wesley K.
