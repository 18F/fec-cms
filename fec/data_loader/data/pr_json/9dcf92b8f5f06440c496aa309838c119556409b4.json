The audit found that the committee failed to maintain records; failed to disclose contributions and exercise best efforts to obtaincontributor information; failure to disclose and continually report outstanding debts and obligations; failed to disclose operating expenditures; made excessive cash disbursements; misstated financial activity; failed to deposit receipts in campaign depositories; failed to properly report campaign depositories; and used campaign funds for personal use. The Commission conciliated with all respondents and the matter is now closed. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\"><p>Documents from these matters are available from the \n              Commission's web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering \n              5406 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.

The complaint alleged that telephone expenses, consultant fees, newspaper and radio advertisements, membership dues, staff salary payments, and disbursements for &#8220;constituent services&#8221; were expenses of the congressional campaign, but were paid for with monies from the state senate committee account. After reviewing disclosure reports the Commission found that the facts did not appear to support the complaint&#8217;s allegations regarding web site consultant fees, newspaper and radio advertising, congressional staff salaries and the general increase in the state senate committee&#8217;s spending in 2003. However, there appeared to have been de minimis violations of the &#8220;soft money&#8221; rules in connection with the sate senate committee&#8217;s payment of telephone expenses on behalf of the congressional campaign and the personal use rules in connection with the payment of Ms. Foxx&#8217;s membership dues in the Yadkin County Chamber of Commerce. The Commission found reason to believe the respondents violated FECA, but because the amounts in violation were de minimis, the Commission decided to take no further action but send admonishment letters. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td><p>Documents from these matters are available from the Commission's web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5424 under the case number in the Enforcement Query System.
