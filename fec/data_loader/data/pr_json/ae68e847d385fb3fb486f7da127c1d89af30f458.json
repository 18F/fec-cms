Gonzalez, the Charles A. Gonzalez Congressional Campaign, West San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, Tom Frost, III, Hearst Newspaper Partnership, LP, and Intercontinental Hotels Group Resources, Inc.&#160; The complaint centered around a dinner reception hosted by Congressman Gonzalez on behalf of the West San Antonio Chamber of Commerce and a related newspaper advertisement.&#160; The Commission determined that the allegations were speculative and/or specifically refuted.</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p>This release contains only disposition information.</p>\n      <table width=\"91%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"3%\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"13%\" valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5774&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5774</a></p></td>\n          <td width=\"84%\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"3%\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"13%\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"84%\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"3%\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"13%\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"84%\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160; Doug Lamborn for Congress, Kathleen A.

The Lamborn Committee asserted that it had not engaged in any coordination with CFGSA or the Christian Coalition and that the addresses were available from a variety of public sources.&#160; CFGSA asserted that it had purchased the absentee voter list from a commercial list vender, and CFGSA and the Christian Coalition both denied any coordination with Doug Lamborn for Congress. The Commission found no reason to believe any of the respondents violated the Act. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"3%\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p>\n          <p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"13%\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"84%\" valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the</p>\n            <p>Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering</p>\n          <p> 5774 under case numbers in the Enforcement Query System.

Jackson, Jr., and Senator Barack Obama were featured in a radio advertisement endorsing Alexander Giannoulias, a non-federal candidate for Illinois State Treasurer. The ad was paid for by Citizens for Giannoulias, using non-federal funds. The complaint alleged that the respondents violated the electioneering communications provisions of the Act by spending non-federal funds to finance the radio advertisement. The Commission found that the advertisement was not an electioneering communication because it satisfied an exemption for endorsements of state and local candidates that do not promote, support, attack or oppose a Federal candidate. <br/>\n            In addition to the radio advertisement, Rep. Jackson was featured in a billboard ad endorsing Giannoulias. The complaint alleged that both the radio and billboard advertisements were improperly coordinated. The Commission found no reason to believe that Senator Obama accepted excessive or prohibited contributions since the ads did not satisfy any of the content standards of the coordination regulation. The Commission dismissed coordination allegations made again Rep. Jackson as a matter of prosecutorial discretion on the grounds that neither ad mentioned Jackson&#8217;s candidacy for Federal office and both would satisfy new regulations that exempt certain endorsements of state candidates from the coordination rules.</p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the</p>\n            <p>Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering</p>\n          <p> 5718 under case numbers in the Enforcement Query System.
