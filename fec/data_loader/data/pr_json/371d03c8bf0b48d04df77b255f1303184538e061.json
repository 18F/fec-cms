In two matters, the Commission admonished the individuals and groups accused of violating the law. In two additional matters, the FEC took no further action and closed the files. In another two matters, the FEC found no reason to believe a violation occurred, and it dismissed the final two cases.</p>\n                <p>Under the law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases, or MURs, through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group. Additional information regarding MURs can be found on the FEC web site at <a href=\"../../em/mur.shtml\">http://www.fec.gov/em/mur.shtml</a>. </p>\n                <p>This release contains only summary information.
