The complaint also states that the ULCU and its member credit unions expressly advocated the election of Mr. Bishop through a newsletter, direct mailings, recorded messages and polling, and neighborhood canvassing. The Act did not require ULCU to report the costs associated with the newsletter, and qualified as a membership communication, which primarily addressed nonfederal election matters. The costs associated with the telephone polling and the neighborhood canvassing were also not required to be reported under the Act because the telephone poll did not constitute express advocacy and the canvassing was unreimbursed volunteer activity. Based on vendor invoices, the Respondents accurately reported all expenditures associated with direct mailings and recorded telephone messages that advocated voting for Mr. Bishop. The loan documentation submitted by the credit union indicates the terms of the loan were not unduly favorable to Mr. Bishop and the credit union followed customary practices and procedures when it approved the loan.&#160; Therefore, the Commission found no reason to believe that any violations occurred with regard to this matter. </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\"><p>Documents from these matters are available from the \n              Commission's web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering \n              5381 under case number.

Bush on its website. The complaint also state that the photograph of President Bush on the website that linked to a list of endorsed candidates violated the law which allows limited corporate endorsements and prohibits electioneering communications by the corporations to those outside the restricted class because it was within 30 days of the Republican National Convention. The Commission found reason to believe that WRTL violated the law because endorsements posted on its website were communicated outside the corporation&#8217;s restricted class, but took no further action and sent an admonishment letter. The Commission found no reason to believe with regard to the electioneering communication by WRTL, since a communication over the Internet does not fall within the statutory definition of an electioneering communication under the law. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td><p>Documents from these matters are available from the Commission's web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering 5522 under case number.
