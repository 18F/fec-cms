BROOKE, TREAS...RONALD A. GYURE...DEM</p>\n\n<p>NC/04...WARD FOR CONGRESS...DR. J. ALLEN LEWIS, TREAS...JESS WARD...REP</p>\n\n<p>NC/06...COBLE FOR CONGRESS...WILLIAM H. KNIGHT, TREAS...JOHN H. COBLE...REP</p>\n\n<p>NC/08...MIKE TAYLOR FOR CONGRESS...LEN BRAFFORD, TREAS...MIKE TAYLOR...DEM</p>\n\n<p>NC/09...CLEMENT FOR CONGRESS...JERI CLEMENT, TREAS...JERI CLEMENT...DEM</p>\n\n<p>NC/10...CASS BALLENGER FOR CONGRESS COMMITTEE...MELISSA B. JORDAN, TREAS...THOMAS CASS\nBALLENGER...REP</p>\n\n<p>NC/12...MEL WATT FOR CONGRESS COMMITTEE...BOBBY T. MARTIN, TREAS...MELVIN L. WATT...DEM</p>\n\n<p>The reports were due by close-of-business April 20, and were to include financial\nactivity from April 1 through April 12. If sent by certified or registered mail, the\nreports should have been postmarked by April 17.</p>\n\n<p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal\nelection law, even though their names may appear on state ballots. If an individual raises\nor spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to\nreporting under the FECA.</p>\n\n<p>The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential filing\nrequirements on March 27. Those committees which did not file on the due date were\nnotified on April 21 that reports had not been received and that their names would be\npublished if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n\n<p>Other political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those\nwhich are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to file\npre-primary reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names are not published\nby the FEC.</p>\n\n<p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a\ncase-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement\nactions, including the imposition of civil penalties ($5,500 for \"any violation\"\nand $11,000 for any \"knowing and willful\" violation).</p>\n\n<p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees will be the\nquarterly report, due July 15. It will cover activity from April 13 through June 30.</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\">&#160;</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p>\n</body>\n", "href": "mur04282000.htm", "date": "04/28/2000", "pdf": null, "title": "Campaigns Cited for Failure to File Pre-Primary Report", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
