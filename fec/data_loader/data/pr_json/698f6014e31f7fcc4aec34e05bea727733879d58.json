The law requires candidates for the House of Representatives to notify the FEC and opponents within 24 hours of making personal funds expenditures that exceed the $350,000 threshold for possible increases in contribution limits for opponents.&#160; Crotts for Congress filed its first notification on May 18, 2004, more than five weeks after the loan was received.</p>\n      <p>The law also requires that candidates declare in their initial statement of candidacy filed with the FEC that they intend to spend personal funds in their campaign.&#160; Mr. Crotts failed to provide this notification initially, and eventually filed it only after he was questioned by the Commission about this omission.&#160; </p>\n      <p>The conciliation agreement signed by the FEC and the respondents calls for a civil penalty of $40,000.</p>\n      <p>In MUR 5488, the FEC has entered into a conciliation agreement with Brad Smith for Congress, James Bailey as treasurer, and Bradley Smith, who was a candidate in the Republican primary in Michigan&#8217;s 7th district.&#160; The Commission found that the Smith for Congress committee accepted $40,500 in excessive contributions from individuals because the committee incorrectly calculated its eligibility for increased limits under the millionaire&#8217;s amendment.&#160; </p>\n      <p>While Oscar Gene Derossett, one of Smith&#8217;s opponents, spent more than $350,000 of his own funds, Smith had also used personal funds in his campaign, and generally it is the difference between one candidates spending and his opponents that determines eligibility.&#160; Some personal funds were repaid to Smith after Derossett disclosed the loan that exceeded the $350,000 threshold.&#160; Under FEC rules, however, these refunds may not be considered in calculating the difference in personal funds between candidates.&#160; </p>\n      <p>Smith and his committee have agreed to refund or seek reattribution for the excessive contributions, and to pay a $14,000 civil penalty.</p>\n      <p/></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"left\" colspan=\"3\"><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n        <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>MUR 5488 </strong></p></td>\n        <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n        <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n        <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n        <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n        <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a) Brad Smith for Congress, James Bailey, treasurer</p>\n          <p>(b) Bradley Smith  </p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n        <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n        <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>John Truscott </p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n        <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n        <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>&#160;Excessive contributions</p>\n            </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n        <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DISPOSITION:</strong></p></td>\n        <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a-b)&#160; Conciliation Agreement: $14,000 civil penalty<strong>*</strong></p>\n          &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Respondents have voluntarily begun refunding all &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; contributions, and as part of the conciliation agreement, &#160;&#160; Respondents will refund to contributors or seek &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; reattributions for all contributions in excess of the normal limits by June 15, 2005.
