On February 21, the Commission made public a revised <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/201318_1.pdf\">draft</a> of Advisory Opinion 2013-18 in response to a request from Revolution Messaging, LLC. The requestor asks whether the proposed mobile phone banner advertisements are exempt from the disclaimer requirement of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act).</p>\n          <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n          <p>The Commission made public one closed case, as follows. For more information, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.</p>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6610</a> <br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: David Wolfson<br/>\n  RESPONDENTS: Friends of Cliff Stearns and Joan Stearns, in her official capacity as treasurer; and Clifford B. &#8220;Cliff&#8221; Stearns<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Friends of Cliff Stearns and Joan Stearns, in her official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) failed to include a proper disclaimer on its website and on three email communications. The complaint also alleged that the website failed to provide required information pertaining to contributions.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe the Committee failed to include proper disclaimers because (1) the Commission&#8217;s disclaimer requirements apply to substantially similar e-mails sent by a political committee numbering in excess of 500 and (2) the Committee&#8217;s website does not appear to have lacked the requisite disclaimer at the time the complaint was filed. The Commission also found no reason to believe as to the allegation concerning the Committee website's contribution information, because the Committee fell outside the scope of the regulations at issue. The Commission found no reason to believe Stearns violated the Act or Commission regulations.</p>\n          <p><strong>ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong><br/>\n              <br/>\n  The Commission made public one campaign finance enforcement matter that was resolved through its Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) program, as follows.
