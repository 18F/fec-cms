Ortiz in Texas&#8217; 27th district.&#160; The committee&#8217;s treasurer is Adelfino Palacios. </p>\n              <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This report was due to the FEC February 21, 2008, and should have included financial activity for the period January 1, 2008, through February 13, 2008. If sent by certified or registered mail, the report should have been postmarked by February 18, 2008.</p>\n              <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state ballots.&#160; If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the Act.</p>\n              <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential filing requirements on January 28, 2008.&#160; Those committees who did not file on the due date were notified on<strong> </strong>February 22, 2008, that reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n              <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Other political committees that support Senate and House candidates in elections, but are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign, are also required to file pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly.&#160; Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n              <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions, and the FEC has implemented an administrative fine program with provisions for assessing monetary penalties.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p/>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
