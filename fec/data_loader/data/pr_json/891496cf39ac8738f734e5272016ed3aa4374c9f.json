On March 1, the Commission concluded that the Justice Party of Mississippi (JPMS) will qualify as a state committee of a political party when a JPMS nominee for federal office whose name appears on the election ballot qualifies as a \"candidate\" under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) and Commission regulations. A state party organization not affiliated with a national political party qualifies as a state committee of a political party if three criteria are met: (1) the state party organization itself must qualify as a \"political party\"; (2) the state party organization itself must possess an official party structure; and (3) the state party organization must be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the party at the state level.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong><a href=\"../../agenda/2012/mtgdoc_1216.pdf\">AO 2012-03 (ActRight)</a></strong>. On March 1, the Commission concluded that ActRight, a nonconnected political committee, may solicit unlimited contributions from individuals, political committees, corporations, and labor organizations that are earmarked for nonconnected political committees that make only independent expenditures or nonconnected committees that accept the funds into a separate non-contribution account for the purpose of making independent expenditures, and ActRight may forward the earmarked contributions to those committees. ActRight will be required to forward contributions and contribution information to the treasurers of the recipient committees within the time frames as defined in the Act and Commission regulations and to comply with the Commission's reporting requirements.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong><u>Advisory Opinions Considered</u></strong></p>\n        <p><strong><u/></strong></p>\n        <p><strong><u><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1191325.pdf\">AOR 2012-01 (Stop This Insanity, Inc. Employee Leadership Fund)</a></u></strong>. On March 1, the Commission discussed and voted on two draft advisory opinions but did not reach consensus on either draft based on a request from Stop This Insanity, Inc. (STI), regarding the activities of STI&#8217;s separate segregated fund, the Employee Leadership Fund (ELF). ELF maintains an account consisting of funds subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of the Act, which are solicited from STI's<strong> </strong>restricted class. ELF asked whether it may open a separate non-contribution account into which STI and ELF would solicit unlimited contributions from STI's restricted class as well as other STI employees and members of the general public, including individuals, political committees, corporations, and labor organizations. Funds in ELF's non-contribution account would be used to finance independent expenditures.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>Advisory Opinions and Requests are available through the <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">Advisory Opinions search page</a> in the Law and Regulations section of the Commission website. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public two closed cases and three Statements of Reasons this week.

Baur, in her official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n        COMPLAINANT:&#160; Chris Redfern, Chairman, Ohio Democratic Party<br/>\n        SUBJECT: &#160;The complaint alleged that American Crossroads, an independent expenditure-only political committee, and Clancy, in her official capacity as treasurer, made an excessive contribution to Portman for Senate Committee and Baur, in her official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) when it spent $454,341.80 to create and air a television advertisement that included video footage previously produced as part of the Committee&#8217;s campaign materials. The complaint alleged further that because American Crossroads made a contribution by republishing campaign materials, it was no longer permitted to avail itself of the exception to contribution limits for independent expenditure-only political committees and thus each subsequent contribution it accepted in excess of $5,000, or from a corporation, labor union, or other prohibited source resulted in a violation of campaign finance law.<br/>\n        DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe that the Committee accepted an excessive in-kind contribution from American Crossroads in the form of a coordinated communication because there was no information that respondents satisfied any of the tests for the conduct prong of the coordination regulation. The Commission closed the file in connection with the remaining allegations. Statements of Reasons were issued by <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocsMUR/12044312281.pdf\">Chair Caroline C.
