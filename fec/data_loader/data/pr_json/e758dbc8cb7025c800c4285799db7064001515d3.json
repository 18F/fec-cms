(CDA) violated the Act.&#160; The matter centered on allegations that the committee improperly registered with the FEC as a nonconnected committee instead of a separate segregated fund (SSF) sponsored by Cuba Democracy Advocates, Inc., and accepted prohibited foreign national contributions from CDA&#8217;s founder Leopoldo Fernandez-Pujals.&#160; The Commission concluded there was no information indicating the PAC was financially supported by CDA or that the individuals identified in the complaint made prohibited contributions to U.S. &#8211; Cuba Democracy PAC.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5711, the Commission found no reason to believe Senator Barbara Boxer (CA), Senator Dianne Feinstein (CA) or Representative Nancy Pelosi (CA/08) violated the Act by soliciting funds that violated the limits and prohibitions of the Act in connection with a non-federal election.&#160; The complaint alleged the Federal officeholders solicited contributions for California gubernatorial candidate Phil Angelides because their names and images appeared on his campaign committee&#8217;s website and they were listed as &#8220;Campaign Co-Chairs.&#8221;&#160; The Commission concluded that the Angelides homepage on which the Federal officeholders appeared did not constitute a solicitation.&#160; A Statement of Reasons from Chairman Lenhard, Vice Chairman Mason, and Commissioners von Spakovsky and Walther is available at: http://www.fec.gov/members/von_Spakovsky/sor/sormur5711.pdf.</p>\n              <p>MUR 5865 stemmed from allegations that the New Trier Democratic Organization (NTDO) made, and that Dan Seals for Congress, the principal campaign committee of 2006 House candidate Dan Seals (IL/10), received, an in-kind contribution when NTDO paid for a mass mailing that advocated Seals&#8217; election.&#160; The complaint alleged each committee failed to report the in-kind contribution and that the communication failed to include adequate disclaimers.&#160; The FEC found that the complaint provided no facts to support the claim that NTDO coordinated the mailing with the Seals committee.&#160; The Commission admonished NTDO for failing to include adequate disclaimers in the communication and found no reason to believe NTDO or Dan Seals for Congress violated the Act by failing to report an in-kind contribution.&#160; </p>\n              <p>In MUR 5860, the Commission found no reason to believe that Friends of Conrad Burns, the principal campaign committee of Senator Conrad Burns (MT), violated the Act.&#160; The complaint was filed by a resident of Montana who allegedly received a 60-second automated phone call on Burns&#8217; behalf in September 2006 that included no disclaimer information.&#160; The complainant alleged the call was made by the Senator&#8217;s re-election campaign or another organization working on Senator Burns&#8217; behalf.&#160; Senator Burns&#8217; campaign stated categorically that it had no role in or knowledge of the phone call. &#160;The Commission had no information to the contrary and no information implicating the involvement of any other registered political committee, working either independently or on behalf of the Burns campaign, in the telephone call alleged in the complaint.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5755, the Commission initially found reason to believe that NDN Political Fund (NDN) failed to register and report as a political committee and to comply with the Act&#8217;s contribution limits and source prohibitions (or, in the alternative, that NDN and the existing New Democrat Network PAC were operating as a single political committee which failed to properly allocate federal funds for certain expenses).&#160; The FEC concluded that evidence obtained during the investigation did not support the conclusion that NDN should have registered as a political committee or that the group and its existing PAC were operating as a single political committee.&#160; The Commission therefore voted to take no further action in the matter.</p>\n              <p>Under the law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases or Matters Under Review (MURs) through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group the Commission determines has violated the law.&#160;
