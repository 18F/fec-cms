The committee&#8217;s treasurer is L. Lee Whitnum.</p>\n              <p>The report was due on July 31, 2008, and should have included financial activity for the period July 1, 2008, through July 23, 2008. &#160;If sent by certified or registered mail, the report should have been postmarked by July 28, 2008.</p>\n              <p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state ballots.&#160; If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the Act.</p>\n              <p>The FEC notified committees involved in this primary of their potential filing requirements on July 7, 2008.&#160; Those committees who did not file on the due date were notified on<strong> </strong>August 1, 2008, that reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n              <p>Other political committees that support Senate and House candidates in elections, but are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign, are also required to file pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly.&#160; Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n              <p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions, and the FEC has implemented an administrative fine program with provisions for assessing monetary penalties.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p/>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
