BROOKE, TREAS...RONALD A. GYURE...DEM</p>\n<p>NC/04...WARD FOR CONGRESS...DR. J. ALLEN LEWIS, TREAS...JESS WARD...REP</p>\n<p>NC/06...COBLE FOR CONGRESS...WILLIAM H. KNIGHT, TREAS...JOHN H. COBLE...REP</p>\n<p>NC/08...MIKE TAYLOR FOR CONGRESS...LEN BRAFFORD, TREAS...MIKE TAYLOR...DEM</p>\n<p>NC/09...CLEMENT FOR CONGRESS...JERI CLEMENT, TREAS...JERI CLEMENT...DEM</p>\n<p>NC/10...CASS BALLENGER FOR CONGRESS COMMITTEE...MELISSA B. JORDAN, TREAS...THOMAS CASS \t\t\tBALLENGER...REP</p>\n<p>NC/12...MEL WATT FOR CONGRESS COMMITTEE...BOBBY T. MARTIN, TREAS...MELVIN L. WATT...DEM</p>\n\n<p>\tThe reports were due by close-of-business April 20, and were to include financial activity from April 1 through April 12.  If sent by certified or registered mail, the reports should have been postmarked by April 17.</p>\n\n<p>\tSome individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state ballots.  If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n\n<p>\tThe FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential filing requirements on March 27.  Those committees which did not file on the due date were notified on April 21 that reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n\n<p>\tOther political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to file pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly.  Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n\n<p>\tFurther Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis.  Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil penalties ($5,500 for \"any violation\" and $11,000 for any \"knowing and willful\" violation).</p>\n\n<p>\tThe next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees will be the quarterly report, due July 15.  It will cover activity from April 13 through June 30.</p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"/>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></font></body>\n", "date": "04/28/2000", "href": "nonfil42800.htm", "category": "Non-Filer Publications", "title": "Campaigns Cited for Failure to File Pre-Primary Report", "pdf": null}
