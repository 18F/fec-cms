Congressional campaign fundraising totaled \n    $390.1 million in 2003, an increase of 32.2% when compared to 2001, as \n    reflected in year-end reports analyzed by the Federal Election Commission (FEC).&#160; \n    This is the first year of fundraising under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform \n    Act of 2002 (BCRA), often referred to as the McCain-Feingold bill.&#160; One of \n    the changes in the new law doubled the individual contribution limit to \n    $2,000 per candidate per election.</p>\n    <p>Much of the increase was found in U.S. \n    Senate campaigns, where candidates raised a total of $166.7 million in 2003, \n    up 72% from 2001 levels.&#160; During 2003 Senate candidates reported \n    disbursements of $66.5 million, more than twice what was spent during the \n    off year of the previous cycle.&#160; Senate candidates ended 2003 with a cash \n    balance of $153.3 million.&#160;</p>\n    <p>Comparisons between election \n    cycles are problematic, however, because different states hold Senate \n    elections each cycle, and many small population states held Senate races in \n    2002.&#160; This year, by contrast, California, New York, and Pennsylvania have \n    Senate campaigns, and Illinois and Florida among other states have open seat \n    Senate races.&#160; Also, some states have earlier Congressional primaries this \n    year to correspond with Presidential primary elections and this may account \n    for some of the increase financial activity in 2003.</p>\n    <p>Candidates for the U.S. House of \n    Representatives raised $223.4 million during 2003, an increase of 12.7% from \n    2001 levels.&#160; These campaigns spent $120.8 million, an increase of 12.8% \n    over 2001.&#160;&#160; They entered the election year with cash-on-hand of $221.4 \n    million, up from the $202.2 million balance reported at the end of 2001. </p>\n    <p>The following table compares non-election \n    year activity (reported in millions of dollars) for all Senate and House \n    campaigns during the last nine election cycles.</p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n      <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n
