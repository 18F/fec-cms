The Democratic Congressional\nCampaign Committee raised $20.8 million, an increase of $8.3 million, or 67%, when\ncompared to the same period in 1997-98.

The National Republican Congressional Committee reported\nreceipts of $45.2 million, an increase of $17.1 million, or 61%, when compared to the\n1997-98 cycle. However, when compared to the 1995-96 cycle, the increase was only $6.2\nmillion, or 16%. </p>\n\n<p>Contributions from individuals made up the bulk of receipts for both parties.\nDemocratic party committees received $74 million, 71%, of their funds from individuals,\nwhile Republicans received $156.3 million, or 87%, from individuals. Democrats received\n$12.6 million from PACs, while Republicans received $9 million. </p>\n\n<p>Democrats reported cash-on-hand of $31.5 million and debts of $3.7 million at the end\nof the 15-month cycle, while Republicans had $32.2 million cash-on-hand and debts of $2.3\nmillion. </p>\n\n<p>Record increases in nonfederal, or \"soft money,\"* activity were reported by\nboth political parties.
