This represents the first decline in off-year\n    fundraising since the Commission began compiling off-year financial totals in 1987. </p>\n    <p>Nearly all the decline was found in U.S. Senate campaigns, where candidates raised a\n    total of $96.7 million in 2001, down 18.6% from 1999 levels. They reported disbursements\n    of $30.3 million, down 30% from the previous cycle. Senate candidates had a cash balance\n    of $84.3 million at the end of 2001. It is important to note, however, that the states\n    having Senate races vary each cycle and the closely contested and open-seat Senate\n    campaigns in 2002 are mainly in small population states where campaign finance activity\n    tends to be smaller. In 2000, open-seat races in Florida, New York and New Jersey and\n    competitive races in other large states made Senate campaigns significantly more expensive\n    than in previous years.</p>\n    <p>Candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives raised $198.2 million during 2001, a\n    decline of just under 1% from 1999 levels. These campaigns spent $107.1 million, an\n    increase of 8% over 1999. They reported cash-on-hand of $202.2 million as of the end of\n    the year, up from the $187.7 million balance reported at the end of 1999. </p>\n    <p>The drop in House fundraising occurred despite ongoing reapportionment and\n    redistricting efforts following the 2000 census. This process generally creates more\n    uncertainty about district boundaries and more open-seat House campaigns, both of which\n    usually result in more fundraising by candidates. For example, House campaign receipts in\n    1991, the last post-census period, were 26% higher than in 1989. </p>\n    <p>Declines are most apparent for House Democratic challengers, with the number of\n    candidates and amounts raised both significantly lower in 2001. Comparisons of the top 50\n    House challengers in contributions from individuals (a measure of broad financial support\n    for a campaign) shows the scope of the decline. In 1999, all 50 candidates received at\n    least $104,000 in these contributions, but in 2001 the 50th challenger received only\n    $44,387. In 1999 only 14 of the top 50 were Republicans while in 2001, 23 were members of\n    the GOP. (Note that district boundaries have not been defined yet in all states, and as a\n    result the \"challenger\" or \"open seat\" status of some House candidates\n    is subject to change.)</p>\n    <p>The following table compares non-election year activity (reported in millions of\n    dollars) for all Senate and House campaigns during the last eight election cycles.</p>\n    <div align=\"center\"><center><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"50%\" cellpadding=\"3\">\n      <tr>\n        <th scope=\"col\" width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" class=\"reduced\">Year</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\" width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" class=\"reduced\">Receipts</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\" width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" class=\"reduced\">Disbursements</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\" width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" class=\"reduced\">Cash on Hand</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"100%\" height=\"17\" colspan=\"4\"><hr size=\"1\" color=\"#000000\"/>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"center\" scope=\"row\">2001</td>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$294.9</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$137.5</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$286.5</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"center\" scope=\"row\">1999</td>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$318.4</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$142.3</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$285.1</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"center\" scope=\"row\">1997</td>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$232.8</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$112.1</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$207.2</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"center\" scope=\"row\">1995</td>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$184.9</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$96.5</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$141.7</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"center\" scope=\"row\">1993</td>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$170.7</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$102.5</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$121.4</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"center\" scope=\"row\">1991</td>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$159.9</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$89.5</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$159.7</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"center\" scope=\"row\">1989</td>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$128.1</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$70.8</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$129.1</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"center\" scope=\"row\">1987</td>\n        <td width=\"19%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$111.5</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$58.6</td>\n        <td width=\"31%\" height=\"17\" align=\"right\">$108.9</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"100%\" height=\"17\" align=\"center\" scope=\"row\" colspan=\"4\"><hr size=\"1\" color=\"#000000\"/>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    </center></div><p>Contributions from individuals remain the largest source of funds for\n    Congressional candidates.
