93% of all Republican \n    party receipts and 83% for the Democrats.&#160; All of the financial activity of \n    these committees during 2003-2004 is ?hard money? raised under the limits \n    and prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act.&#160; This is the first \n    election cycle since the passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of \n    2002 which prohibits unrestricted nonfederal or ?soft money? fundraising by \n    national parties.&#160; PAC contributions to Democratic party committees totaled \n    $12.2 million or 11% of receipts.&#160; PACs gave a similar amount ($12.4 \n    million) to Republican committees but this represented only 5% of their \n    receipts.</p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Direct contributions to candidates and \n    coordinated expenditures on behalf of general election candidates were \n    modest during this period as they have been at this stage in earlier \n    cycles.&#160; The DCCC did, however, make independent expenditures totaling $1.6 \n    million while the NRCC made independent expenditures of&#160; approximately \n    $607,000 in the special election in Kentucky?s 6<sup>th</sup> district.</p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition to summaries for each national \n    committee through February, tables attached to this release provide \n    comparisons with hard money fundraising during nonelection years from 1991 \n    through 2003*.&#160; These tables show significant growth in federal fundraising \n    in 2003 for five of the six national committees.&#160; Only the National \n    Republican Senatorial Committee reported raising less hard money in 2003 \n    than in 2001.&#160; </p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">The following table shows \n    ?hard?
