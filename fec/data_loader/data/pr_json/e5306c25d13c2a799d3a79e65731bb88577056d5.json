In the normal course of its supervisory responsibilities, the Commission discovered that Sollosy, the company&#8217;s Chairman of the Board of Directors, may have violated the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), by accepting reimbursement of his contribution by Solomon.</p></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"22%\" valign=\"top\"><p>OUTCOME:</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"77%\" valign=\"top\"><p>In December 2008, the Commission found reason to believe Solomon violated the Act by making contributions in the names of other people and contributing in excess of the allowable limit to a federal candidate.
