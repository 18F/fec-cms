Since the program was\n    initiated in July 2000, the FEC has processed and made public <u><strong>290</strong></u>\n    cases with <strong><u>$398,436</u></strong> in fines collected.</p>\n    <p>The Administrative Fine Program was initially mandated to cover violations of campaign\n    finance reporting requirements that occurred through December 31, 2001. On November 12,\n    the President signed H.R. 2590, the FY2002 Treasury-Postal Service Appropriations Act that\n    extended the Administrative Fine Program to cover violations that relate to reporting\n    periods through December 31, 2003.</p>\n    <p>The number of reports filed late compared to prior cycles has declined in each\n    reporting period. The largest percentage drop in the number of late filers occurred with\n    the June monthly report, a drop of 18 percentage points from the previous non-election\n    year. The number of non-filers continues to decline, the mid-year report showing a 47%\n    drop (654 reports in 1999 to 345 reports in 2001).</p>\n    <p>Reports are considered to be filed <strong>late</strong> if they are received after the\n    due date, but within 30 days of that due date. Election-sensitive reports will be\n    considered late if they are filed after their due date, but prior to four days before the\n    election. Election sensitive reports are those filed immediately before an election and\n    include pre-primary, pre-special, pre-general, October Quarterly, and October monthly\n    reports. Committees filing reports outside of these parameters are considered <strong>non-filers</strong>.</p>\n    <p>The following tables relate the number of reports filed, the number of reports filed\n    late, and the number of reports not filed for each major report starting with the 2001\n    Mid-Year reports. These figures also are presented for the corresponding reports in 1997\n    and 1999. </p>\n    <h4>Late and Non-Filed Reports</h4>\n    <h5>Mid-Year Reports </h5>\n    <table border=\"1\"
