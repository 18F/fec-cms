These violations include making and receiving excessive contributions from individuals and prohibited corporate contributions and the failure to comply with various reporting requirements.&#160; The FEC accepted conciliation agreements from 11 Respondents with civil penalties aggregating $156,169.07. </p>\n      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The FEC discovered, in the normal course of review of disclosure reports, that the Giordano campaign committee had received a number of excessive and prohibited contributions.&#160; Among these was $300,000 from Salvatore Trovato, Mr. Giordano&#8217;s father in-law.&#160; The funds were placed in a certificate of deposit and used by Mr. Giordano as collateral for a loan to the campaign that was reported as coming from the candidate's personal funds. Mr. Trovato has admitted the violation and agreed to pay a civil penalty of $99,000.&#160; At the time of these events, contributions from individuals were limited to $1,000 per election.&#160; The Commission also found reason to believe that Patriot National Bank violated the Act because the $300,000 loan it made to the campaign appeared not to have been made in the ordinary course of business or on a basis which assures repayment.&#160; Following an investigation, the FEC determined to take no further action with respect to the bank.</p>\n      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In addition, the Commission has entered into conciliation agreements with Arthur A. Watson &amp; Company, Inc., along with several employees of the company, for making prohibited corporate contributions to the Giordano campaign.&#160; Senior Vice President Michael Watts and company President Thomas Willsey were also found to have consented to making corporate contributions, and to have assisted Arthru A. Watson &amp; Company in making contributions in the names of others. Arthur A. Watson &amp; Company and its employees have agreed to pay civil penalties totaling $47,000.&#160; The FEC also entered into an agreement with En-Tech Corporation, in which the company has agreed to a $1,250 penalty for making corporate contributions. The FEC also found reason to believe that prohibited contributions were received from six other companies, but took no further action with respect to them.</p>\n      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Act prohibits corporations from making contributions or expenditures from their general treasury funds in connection with any election of any candidate for federal office. It also prohibits officers and directors of a corporation from consenting to any contribution prohibited under that section.</p>\n      <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Giordano U.S. Senate Committee admitted to knowingly and willfully violating the law by accepting and not refunding, excessive contributions from individuals in the amount of $3,500 and contributions from corporations in the amount of $6,750. The civil penalty of $919.07 contained in the conciliation agreement, represented all of the Committee&#8217;s remaining assets. James S. Paolino, the committee's former treasurer, and Thomas M. Ariola, the former deputy treasurer, signed agreements admitting to accepting excessive contributions and underreporting committee receipts.&#160; Mr. Paolino agreed to a $5,500 civil penalty and Mr. Ariola agreed to pay $2,500. (These civil penalties reflect factors relating to the respondents&#8217; financial condition.)</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p/>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5453&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR</a></strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5453&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong> 5453</strong></a></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160; Giordano for U.S. Senate Committee</p>\n              <p>(b)&#160; James S.
