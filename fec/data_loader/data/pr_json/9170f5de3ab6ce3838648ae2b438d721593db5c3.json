This area of the Commission&#146;s web site will provide basic\n    information about the law and programs under the FEC&#146;s jurisdiction.<p>The site (<a href=\"bkgnd/bkgnd.shtml\">http://www.fec.gov/press/bkgnd/bkgnd.shtml</a>) currently includes\n    a summary of the new provisions of the campaign finance law (the McCain-Feingold bill)\n    being implemented in the 2004 election cycle. The summary includes a brief description of\n    each element in the law, along with links to definitions and other resources that should\n    be helpful for more detailed research. </p>\n    <p>A second backgrounder provides basic information about the presidential public funding\n    system, along with the FEC&#146;s projections for spending limits and funding availability\n    at each stage of the 2004 presidential campaign. </p>\n    <p>Also included is a list of civil penalties assessed by the FEC for violations of the\n    law where the amount of the penalty was $50,000 or more. The list identifies the case and\n    lists the main respondents, along with their civil penalty amounts and a very brief\n    description of the nature of the violation. </p>\n    <p>The backgrounders can also be located by using the \"Media Guide\" at\n    www.fec.gov. </p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"100%\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "date": "02/21/2003", "href": "20030221advisory.html", "category": "Other Agency Actions", "title": "FEC Press Office Releases Backgrounders for Reporters Web Page", "pdf": null}
