Non-connected PACs (those which are not connected to or sponsored by a\ncorporation or labor organization, and which are not related to a candidate's campaign or\nto a political party organization) must register within 10 days after certain financial\nactivity exceeds $1,000 during a calendar year. </p>\n\n<p>Registration does not necessarily imply financial activity. Many PACs report making no\ncontributions to candidates or independent expenditures on behalf of or against\ncandidates. Financial information on PACs will be included in future FEC news releases.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"pacchart.htm\">following chart details the number\nof PACs in existence since the end of 1974.</a></p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\">&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n</body>\n", "date": "02/12/1999", "href": "paccnt99.htm", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries", "title": "FEC Releases Semi-Annual Federal PAC Count", "pdf": null}
