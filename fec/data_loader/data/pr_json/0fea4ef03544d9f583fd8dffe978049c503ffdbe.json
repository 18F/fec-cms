See ]</p>\n            <p/>\n            The complaint involved allegations that individuals using the names &#8220;Jade Newhart&#8221; and &#8220;Bill Baulding&#8221; of NSD violated the Act by fraudulently misrepresenting their organization as acting on behalf of the Gephardt Committee in connection with the planning of a fundraiser for the purpose of soliciting funds. The Gephardt committee asserted that no person associated with it had knowledge of the activities of Baulding, Newhart, or NSD.&#160; The investigation revealed that the two individuals involved in the fundraising scheme, Blanchi and Willaim Dugatkin used multiple aliases, including &#8220;Jade Newhart&#8221; and &#8220;Bill Baulding,&#8221; and changed addresses frequently to conceal their whereabouts. &#160;As part of a global settlement with Department of Justice, the Commission settled civil violations of the Act in an addendum to a plea agreement signed by the Dugatkins, in which they each pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal violations. Following the court&#8217;s sentencing of the Dugatkins, the Commission closed the file in this matter. The Commission also decided to take no further action with respect to NSD because it was, exclusively used as a shell for the Dugatkins to participate in a fraudulent solicitation scheme. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5384 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p>&#160;</p>\n          </td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>2.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5385&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>MUR 5385</strong></a><strong> </strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Groundswell Voters PAC </p>\n            <p>(b)&#160;&#160; Jerome Dewald</p>\n            (c)&#160;&#160; Jonathan Mosier </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p> Gephardt for President, Inc.  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p> Fraudulent solicitation of funds; failure to register and report; impermissible use of contributor list for solicitation purposes  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>DISPOSITION:</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a-c)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Reason to believe, took no further action*[re: knowing and willful fraudulent solicitation of funds; impermissible use of contributor list for solicitation purposes]</p>\n            <p>(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Reason to believe, took no further action* [re: failure to register and report]</p>\n            <p>(a-b)&#160;&#160;&#160; Send admonishment letters.</p>\n            <p/>\n            The complaint alleged that Groundswell Voters PAC violated the Act by fraudulently misrepresenting that it was acting on behalf of former Congressman Richard Gephardt in mailing undated fundraising letters requesting contributions of up to $5,000 to fund a purported grassroots effort to benefit Gephardt for President, Inc. The Gephardt Committee asserted that Groundswell had no authority to act on its behalf and it was wholly unaware of the organizations&#8217; fundraising activities until it obtained copies of the Groundswell solicitations. The complaint also alleged that Groundswell obtained the names of individuals it solicited for contributions from reports on file with the Commission and that Groundswell failed to register as a political committee with the Commission. The Commission found reason to believe that Groundswell and two individuals, Jerome DeWald and Jonathan Mosier, violated the law. \n\n\nMr. Dewald was imprisoned on state fraud charges in the fall of 2003.\n\nFollowing an investigation, the Commission took no further action as to these Respondents but admonished Groundswell and Jerome Dewald that fraudulent solicitation is a violation of the Act, and closed the file.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"21\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"146\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"351\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering  5385 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>3.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5650&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>MUR 5650</strong></a><strong> </strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a) University of Arizona, by and through the Arizona Board  of Regents</p>\n            <p>(b) Associated Students of the University of Arizona (ASUA)</p>\n            <p>(c)&#160; Alistair J.

Therefore, the complainant alleged the debate constituted an illegal in-kind contribution from the University of Arizona to the McCain and Starky campaigns. The Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of the University denied the complainant&#8217;s claim that the McCain and/or Starky campaigns were responsible for excluding Hancock from the debate and that University does not endorse, support, or oppose political candidates or political parties. Moreover, the University contended that even it were deemed a corporation for purposes of the Federal Election Campaign Act, it met all the requirements of the Commission&#8217;s debate staging regulations when it staged the debate. Also, the University stated that the two former ASUA Officers, Alistair Chapman and Fernando Ascencio recalled speaking with the complainant after the debate, but did not recall telling the complainant that Hancock was excluded at the request of the McCain or Starky campaigns.
