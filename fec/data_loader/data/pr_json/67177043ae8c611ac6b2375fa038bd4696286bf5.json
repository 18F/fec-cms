If an individual raises or spends $5,000 or less, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the Act.</p>\n        <p>The Commission notified committees of their potential filing requirements on September 19, 2014. Those committees that did not file on the due date were sent notification on October 22, 2014 that their reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days. </p>\n        <p>Other political committees that support Senate and House candidates in elections, but are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign, are also required to file quarterly reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names are not published by the Commission.</p>\n        <p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the Commission broad authority to initiate enforcement actions, and the Commission has implemented an Administrative Fine program with provisions for assessing monetary penalties. </p>\n        <p>&#160;</p>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. </em></p>\n        <p align=\"center\"># # # </p>\n        <p/></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>      \n      </div>\n      ", "href": "press2014/news_releases/20141030release.shtml", "date": "10/30/2014", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Cites Committees for Failure to File October Quarterly Financial Report", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
