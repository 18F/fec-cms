The Commission found reason to believe that Doggett for Congress violated the Act, but took into consideration mitigating circumstances surrounding the misstatement of activity.&#160; The Committee agreed to pay a $6,500 civil penalty in connection with the reporting violations.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5678, the FEC found reason to believe that the Bully PAC Inc., a political action committee (PAC), violated the Act by making an excessive in-kind contribution to Liffrig for Senate, the principal campaign committee of Michael Liffrig, a 2004 Republican Senate candidate in North Dakota.&#160; In a conciliation agreement with the Commission, Bully PAC agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, waive its right to a refund of the excessive portion of the contribution and instruct Liffrig for Senate to give the excessive $4,000 to the U.S. Treasury.&#160; Additional allegations made by the complainant were dismissed.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5597, the Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the complaint against John Wolfe, Jr., a 2004 Democratic Congressional candidate in Tennessee&#8217;s third Congressional District.&#160; The complaint centered on the candidate&#8217;s weekly radio show.&#160; However, the Commission determined that none of the allegations warranted an investigation.</p>\n              <p>This release contains only disposition information.</p>\n              <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5659&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>MUR 5659</strong></a></strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Democratic Party of Hawaii and Lynn Matusow, in her official capacity as Treasurer</p>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>FEC Initiated (Audit)</p></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Acceptance of prohibited contributions;
