Stein is seeking the Green Party nomination  for president for 2016.</p>\n        <p>          To become eligible for matching funds, candidates must raise a threshold amount  of $100,000 by collecting $5,000 in 20 different states in amounts no greater  than $250 from any individual. Other requirements to be declared eligible include  agreeing to an overall spending limit, abiding by spending limits in each  state, using public funds only for legitimate campaign-related expenses,  keeping financial records and permitting an extensive campaign audit.<br/>\n          <br/>\n          Based on documents filed by Jill Stein for President on March 28, 2016,  contributions from the following states were verified for threshold purposes:  Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland,  Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,  Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. All of the  materials included with this submission may be viewed <a href=\"../../../finance/disclosure/2016MatchingFundSubmissions.shtml\"><span class=\"style2\">here</span></a><span class=\"style1\">.  </span> Based on Stein&#8217;s initial threshold submission,  the Commission has requested that the United States Treasury make an initial  payment of $100,000 to Stein&#8217;s campaign.</p>\n        <p>          Once declared eligible, campaigns may submit additional contributions for  matching funds on the first business day of every month. The maximum amount a  primary candidate could receive is currently estimated to be about $48.01  million.<br/>\n          <br/>\n          The presidential public funding program is financed through the $3 check-off  that appears on individual income tax returns. The program now has two  elements: matching payments to participating candidates during the primary  campaign and grants available to nominees to pay for the general election  campaign. On April 3, 2014, President Barack Obama signed legislation to end  the public funding of presidential nomination conventions. <br/>\n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n          <em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory  agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has  jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of  Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency.  Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners who are nominated  by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.</em>\n        </p>\n        <p><br/>\n  <br/>\n</p>\n<div align=\"center\">Follow Us on Twitter - <u>http://twitter.com/fec</u><br/>\n</div>\n        <div align=\"left\"/></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>      \n      </div>\n      ", "date": "04/14/2016", "href": "press2016/news_releases/20160414release.shtml", "category": "Presidential Public Funds ", "title": "FEC Declares Jill Stein Eligible to Receive Federal Matching Funds", "pdf": null}
