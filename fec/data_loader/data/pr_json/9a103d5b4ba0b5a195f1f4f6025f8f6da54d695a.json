This brings to \n    101 the total number of cases released, since the ADR program began October \n    2, 2000. The program&#146;s goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement \n    matters, reduce the cost of processing complaints, and enhance overall FEC \n    enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available in the \n    FEC&#146;s Press and Public Records offices.<p>For a case to be considered for \n    ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR \n    process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is \n    pending in the ADR Office, and agree to participate in bilateral \n    negotiations and, if necessary, mediation.</p>\n    <p>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching an \n    expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both \n    satisfying to the respondent(s) and in compliance with the Federal Election \n    Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions reached through direct and, when necessary, \n    mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval. \n    If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds \n    by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved \n    through ADR are not precedential.</p>\n    <p align=\"RIGHT\"/>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\" valign=\"TOP\">1.</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">ADR 130</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"6%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">RESPONDENTS:</td>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"TOP\">Washtenaw County Democratic Party, Barbara \n        R.
