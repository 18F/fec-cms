The Federal Election Commission (FEC) has established a second \n    email account to receive comments from persons who wish to testify at the \n    Commission hearings on April 14 and 15 concerning the Notice of Proposed \n    Rulemaking on Political Committee Status. The new email account is\n    <a href=\"mailto:pcstestify@fec.gov\">pcstestify@fec.gov</a>. The Commission \n    is asking that anyone who has already sent an email requesting to testify to \n    the main email account to please resend their email to the new account. \n    Those who want to send in comments but who do not request to testify should \n    continue to send their comments to the main email account\n    <a href=\"mailto:politicalcommitteestatus@fec.gov\">\n    politicalcommitteestatus@fec.gov</a>.<p>The notice of proposed rulemaking, \n    which can be found at \n    http://www.fec.gov/register.htm [expired link] , was published in the Federal Register \n    on March 11, 2004. The FEC is undertaking this rulemaking to determine \n    whether the current definition of \"political committee\" adequately \n    encompasses all organizations that should be considered political committees \n    subject to the limitations, prohibitions and reporting requirements of the \n    Act. A similar review of the definition of \"expenditure\" and its \n    implications, along with the rules for allocating funds for activities \n    involving both federal and nonfederal elections are also a part of this \n    rulemaking. </p>\n    <p>Commenters wishing to testify at the hearings on April 14 and 15, must \n    submit their request along with their written or electronic comments by \n    April 5, 2004. Those who do not wish to testify must submit their written or \n    electronic comments by April 9, 2004</p>\n    <p>All electronic mail comments should be addressed to Ms. Mai T. Dinh, \n    Acting Assistant General Counsel, and must include the full name, electronic \n    mail address, and postal service address of the commenter. Faxed comments \n    should be sent to (202) 219-3923, with printed copy follow-up to ensure \n    legibility. Written comments and printed copies of faxed comments should be \n    sent to the Federal Election Commission, 999 E Street, N.W., Washington, \n    D.C. 20463. </p>\n    <p align=\"center\">###</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  </table>\n</body>\n", "date": "04/02/2004", "href": "press2004/20040402nprm.html", "category": "Hearings", "title": "New Email Address for Hearing on Proposed Political Committee Status Rules", "pdf": null}
