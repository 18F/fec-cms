From January 1, 1997, through\nMarch 31, 1998,  166 Senate candidates raised $140.3 million and\nspent $70.9 million, while 1,343 House candidates  raised $197.9\nmillion and spent $113.9 million.\n</p><p>\nThe following table details a 15-month comparison of campaign\nactivity for  Senate and House candidates in the last five  election\ncycles:\n\n</p><p>\n</p><pre>Cycle\tCandidates\tReceipts\tDisbursements\tCash on Hand\n97-98\t1509\t        $338.9 \t        $185.5 \t        $236.5 \n95-96\t1839\t        $297.0 \t        $177.8 \t        $169.8 \n93-94\t1881\t        $253.9 \t        $163.6 \t        $140.6 \n91-92\t2053\t        $247.5 \t        $170.1 \t        $160.4 \n89-90\t1269\t        $192.5 \t        $126.6 \t        $138.5 \n\t\t(figures in millions)\t</pre>\t\n\nContributions from individuals continue to be the largest source\nof campaign funds.  For the first 15 months of the 1997-98 cycle,\nindividual contributions totalled $192.9 million, or  57% of monies\nraised.  PAC money accounted for $84.5 million, or 25%.  Candidate\nmoney, either in the form of direct contributions or loans, totalled\n$40.7 million, representing 12% of total revenues.  \n<p>\nReceipts for 1998 Senate races increased for both parties, as\ncompetitive races took shape in many large population states,\nsuch as California, New York and Florida. Cycle -to- cycle comparisons\nof Senate activity are difficult because, unlike House races,\ndifferent seats in different states are up for election each cycle.\n \n</p><p>\nIn the House, fundraising increased for Democrats, while remaining\nnearly unchanged for Republicans.  The FEC also found that 478\nmajor party challengers in House races raised $26.4 million, a\n17.5% decline from 1996 levels.  The number of House challengers\nwhose receipts have exceeded $50,000 also declined, from 173 at\nthis point in 1996, to 121 in 1998.  The 403 House incumbents,\nhowever, raised $137.9 million, 9% more than in the previous cycle.\n \n</p><p>\nTables attached to this release offer summary data for Senate\nand House candidates by political party, as well as by candidate\nstatus (incumbent, challenger, or open seat).  Also included are\nrankings of Senate and House candidates for the following categories:\nreceipts, individual contributions, PAC or other committee contributions,\ndisbursements, cash-on-hand and debts.  Six-year financial summaries\nof 1998 Senate candidates, as well as  current cycle financial\nsummaries for each House race are also attached.
