FEC</em> (Case 1:06-cv-01247-CKK), commonly referred to as <em>Shays III</em>.&#160; On September 12, 2007 U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly remanded to the FEC certain provisions of the Commission&#8217;s regulations concerning coordinated communications, voter registration and get-out-the-vote activity. The regulations at issue implement sections of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA, or McCain/Feingold).</p>\n              <p>The Commission will seek appellate review of all the adverse rulings issued by the District Court.&#160; The Commission notes that the District Court decision does not enjoin the operation of the regulations that were found defective.&#160; Rather, the court remanded the case to the Commission &#8220;for further action consistent with th[e] opinion.&#8221;&#160; Absent further instructions from the courts, the Commission&#8217;s current regulations remain in effect until they are revised or repealed.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p/>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
