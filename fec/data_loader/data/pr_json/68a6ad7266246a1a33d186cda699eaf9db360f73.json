On April 3, the Commission made public Advisory Opinion Request 2013-01. The 1787 National Committee is a political committee that is registered with the Commission.&#160; It asks to be recognized as the national committee of a political party.&#160; The Commission will accept written comments on the request during the 10-day period following publication of the request (no later than April 15, 2013) and shall issue a response no later than 60 days after receipt of the complete request, specifically by May 24, 2013.</p>\n        <p><u/></p>\n        <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public two closed cases and one Statement of Reasons. For more information, see the case documents in the&#160;<a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6542</a><br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: Morgan Anderssen-Williams<br/>\n  RESPONDENTS: Markwayne Mullin; Mullin for Congress and Debbie Dooley, in her official capacity as treasurer; Mullin Plumbing, Inc.; Superior Wood Floors, Inc.; Branchcomb, Inc.; Reco Electric Co.; and Mother Nature&#8217;s Inc.<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Mullin for Congress and Dooley, in her official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) accepted impermissible contributions. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Committee made an &#8220;excessive number&#8221; of redesignations and reattributions of contributions and accepted impermissible direct contributions including: (1) contributions in excess of the 2012-cycle $2,500 per election limit, including unidentified contributions of $10,000 or more, (2) unidentified contributions from &#8220;businesses&#8221; that were &#8220;redesignated&#8221; as contributions from individuals, and (3) direct corporate contributions from Superior Wood Floors, Inc., Mother Nature&#8217;s Inc., Reco Electric Co., and Branchcomb, Inc. The complaint alleged further that Mullin Plumbing made and the Committee accepted in-kind corporate contributions when the Committee used Mullin Plumbing resources including &#8220;storefront images, logo-bearing Mullin plumbing vehicles, and business employees&#8221; in the Committee&#8217;s print and video advertising. Mullin was a 2012 candidate for Oklahoma&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe Superior Wood Floors, Inc., Branchcomb, Inc., Reco Electric Co., and Mother Nature&#8217;s, Inc. made and the Committee received prohibited corporate contributions because (1) the Committee timely refunded contributions from Mother Nature&#8217;s Inc., Superior Wood Floors, Inc. and Reco Enterprises (a business with a name similar to Reco Electric Co.) and (2) the president of Branchcomb, Inc., denied making a contribution to the Committee and the Committee asserts that Branchcomb Asphalt, another company with a similar name to a company named in the complaint, is an unincorporated sole proprietorship authorized to make contributions. The Commission dismissed the allegations pertaining to the excessive and prohibited corporate contributions in light of the apparent&#160;de minimis&#160;amounts at issue but cautioned the Committee regarding the receipt of excessive contributions and reminded Mullin, Mullin Plumbing and the Committee concerning the prohibition on corporate contributions.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6543</a><br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: Thomas R. Hawk<br/>\n  RESPONDENTS: Unknown Respondents<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that unknown persons or entities made automated pre-recorded telephone calls containing express advocacy to voters in North Carolina&#8217;s 10th Congressional District without required disclaimers.&#160;<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission closed the file.&#160; A&#160;<a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocsMUR/13044331493.pdf\">Statement of Reasons</a>&#160;was issued by Chair Ellen L.
