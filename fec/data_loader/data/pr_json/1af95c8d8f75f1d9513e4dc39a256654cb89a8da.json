Semi-annual reporting is no longer an option for Congressional committees.</p>\n    <p>July quarterly reports cover financial activity from April 1, 2003, through June 30,\n    2003. The reports are due by close of business Tuesday, July 15, if sent regular mail or\n    hand-delivered. If sent certified or registered mail, disclosure reports must be\n    postmarked no later than midnight of the due date. Electronically filed reports must be\n    received by midnight, eastern time, on the filing date. Senate campaigns file their\n    reports with the Secretary of the Senate, who then forwards the reports to the FEC. All\n    other committees file their reports with the FEC.</p>\n    <p>Digital images of campaign finance reports are available on the FEC Website,\n    www.fec.gov. All reports filed by PACs, political parties, Presidential, Senate and House\n    campaigns are available for viewing on the Web within 48 hours of the reports being\n    received by the FEC. </p>\n    <p>The Public Records Office accepts most major credit cards as method of payment for\n    copying documents and deposits for Public Records accounts.
