The Act requires committees supporting candidates in the primary to file reports of their financial activity 12 days before the election.</p>\n<p>As of 5 p.m., September 14, 2006 a disclosure report from the following committee had not been filed:</p>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"79\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\"><u>State </u></p></td>\n    <td width=\"79\" valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\"><u>District</u></div></td>\n    <td width=\"264\" valign=\"top\"><p><u>Committee</u></p></td>\n    <td width=\"156\" valign=\"top\"><p><u>Treasurer</u></p></td>\n    <td width=\"156\" valign=\"top\"><p><u>Candidate </u></p></td>\n    <td width=\"79\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\"><u>Party</u></p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"79\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\"><strong>WA</strong></p></td>\n    <td width=\"79\" valign=\"top\"><div align=\"center\"><strong>4</strong></div></td>\n    <td width=\"264\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong> CLAUDE OLIVER FOR CONGRESS </strong></p></td>\n    <td width=\"156\" valign=\"top\"><p> <strong>DARYL FRANCIS</strong> </p></td>\n    <td width=\"156\" valign=\"top\"><p> <strong>CLAUDE L.

If sent by certified or registered mail, the report must have been postmarked by September 4, 2006.&#160; </p>\n<p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports even though their names may appear on state ballots. If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n<p>The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of these filing requirements on August 14, 2006. Those committees that did not file on the due date were notified on September 8, 2006 that reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n<p>Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions against non-filers, and the FEC has implemented a new administrative fine program that can subject committees to penalties ranging from $30 to $16,000 or more. </p>\n<p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for these candidate committees will be the October Quarterly Report, due October 15. It will cover activity from August 31 through September 30.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"># # #</p>\n</body>\n"}
