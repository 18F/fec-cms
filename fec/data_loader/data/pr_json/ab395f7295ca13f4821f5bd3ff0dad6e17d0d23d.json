The Commission found that the committee (a) misreported its receipts, disbursements, and cash on hand amounts, (b) received contributions from unregistered political organizations, which may have been made with impermissible funds, and (c) failed to properly document salary and wage expenditures. The report also addressed an additional issue related to potential excessive coordinated party expenditures made in 2006 by the committee, noting that the Commission did not approve a staff recommendation by the required four votes.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>Click here for <a href=\"../../audits/audit_reports.shtml\">general information about final Audit Reports</a>.
