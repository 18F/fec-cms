John Kerry (MA) and his principal campaign committee, John Kerry for Senate Committee. Advisory Opinion Request 2009-11 asks whether the Committee can use campaign funds to assist a film production company with the development costs of a documentary.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>The Commission did not take action on the Advisory Opinion Request but determined instead to continue discussion of the request at the Commission&#8217;s next open meeting. The Commission also invited the requestor and the public to file comments on publicly released alternative draft Advisory Opinions, which are available on the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../law/law.shtml\">www.fec.gov/law/law.shtml</a>.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>The Commission also voted to adopt three proposed findings in an audit report for Ciro D. Rodriguez for Congress (TX-23). The three findings concerned (1) a misstatement of financial activity, (2) failure to file 48-hour notices and (3) acceptance of impermissible contributions. The Commission also adopted a fourth proposed finding concerning the impermissible receipt and use of funds, but amended that finding with respect to the issue of personal use.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><em/></p>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
