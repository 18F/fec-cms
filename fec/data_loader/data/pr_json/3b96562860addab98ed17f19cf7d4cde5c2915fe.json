Election sensitive reports (reports and notices filed immediately prior to an election) receive higher penalties.&#160; Additional information about the Administrative Fine Program is available on the FEC website at <a href=\"../../af/af.shtml\">http://www.fec.gov/af/af.shtml</a>. </p>\n              <p><br/>\n  Tables attached to this release contain summary information on cases closed after June of this year.&#160; Publicly available documents for completed Administrative Fines cases are also available in the Commission&#8217;s Press and Public Records Offices.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p align=\"left\"><strong>Campaign Committees <a href=\"adminfines_candidate.xls\">[excel]</a> <a href=\"adminfines_candidate.pdf\">[pdf]</a> </strong></p>\n              <p align=\"left\"><strong>PAC/Party Committees <a href=\"adminfines_pac.xls\">[excel]</a> <a href=\"adminfines_pac.pdf\">[pdf]</a> </strong></p>\n              <p align=\"center\"/>\n              <p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong>*Late filers are those committees filing non-election sensitive reports after the due date, but within 30 days of the due date and/or filing election sensitive reports after the due date, but prior to four days before the election.
