FEC</em></a> (Case 15-5264)<em>.</em> The panel concluded that there is a substantial likelihood  that the FEC's political committee naming restriction in 11 &#167; C.F.R. 102.14(a), as applied to Pursuing America&#8217;s  Greatness (PAG), violates the First Amendment, while also concluding that PAG  was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its challenge to the regulation under  the Administrative Procedure Act.&#160; The  court reversed the district court&#8217;s decision denying PAG&#8217;s motion for a preliminary injunction and remanded the case to the district  court to enter a preliminary injunction enjoining the application of 11 C.F.R.  &#167; 102.14(a) against PAG&#8217;s websites and social media pages.&#160; &#160;<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency  that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
