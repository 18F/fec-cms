The U.S. \n    Treasury Department will make partial payments on February 2, 2004.</p>\n    <p>This raises to $20,437,489.55 the total amount of federal funds certified \n    thus far to these six candidates who are currently eligible to receive \n    federal primary matching funds. </p>\n    <p>By comparison, in 2000, matching fund payments during a comparable time \n    period went to eight candidates, totaling $39,633,318.37. </p>\n    <p>The following chart lists the amount certified to each candidate, along \n    with the cumulative amount each has been certified to date. Due to the fact \n    that there are insufficient funds to pay these amounts, the Treasury \n    Department will calculate a reduced amount for each campaign. The balance in \n    the fund available for these payments is $2,326,585.27, which will result in \n    payments of approximately 46 cents per dollar certified. Reduced payments \n    will continue until the Fund has been replenished by future checkoff \n    designations on 2003 tax returns, at which time each campaign will receive \n    the amount it is due. </p>\n    </font>\n    <p align=\"RIGHT\"/>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"540\">\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"34%\"><font size=\"3\"><u><b>&#160;</b></u><p>CANDIDATE</p></font></td>\n        <td width=\"38%\"><font size=\"3\"><b>CERTIFICATION <u>TODAY</u></b></font></td>\n        <td width=\"28%\"><font size=\"3\"><b>CUMULATIVE CERTIFICATIONS</b></font></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td width=\"34%\"><font size=\"3\">Wesley K.
