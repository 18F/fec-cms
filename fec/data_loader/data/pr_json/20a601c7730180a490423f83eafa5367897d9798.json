PRISTOOP?DEM </strong></p>\n<p><strong>MO/05?. &#160;&#160;STEVE DENNIS FOR CONGRESS COMMITTEE?ROBERT M. TAMASI, \n  TREAS? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;STEPHEN S. PRISTOOP?REP </strong></p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The report was due July 15, 2004 and should have included \n  financial activity for the period April 1, 2004 through June 30, 2004 . If sent \n  by certified or registered mail, the reports should have been postmarked by \n  July 15, 2004 . Mandatory electronic filing requirements became effective as \n  of January 1, 2001 . Any committee that receives contributions or makes expenditures \n  in excess of $50,000 in the current calendar year, or that reasonably expects \n  to do so, must submit its reports electronically. These rules became effective \n  for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2001 . </p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file \n  reports under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state \n  ballots. If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not \n  considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA. </p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential \n  filing requirements on June 21, 2004 . Those committees which did not file on \n  the due date were notified on <strong/>July 22, 2004 that reports had \n  not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond \n  within four business days. </p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;Other political committees supporting Senate and House candidates \n  in elections (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) \n  also are required to file pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly. Those \n  committee names are not published by the FEC. </p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is \n  decided on a case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to \n  initiate enforcement actions and the FEC has implemented a new administrative \n  fine program which will subject committees to penalties ranging from $30 to \n  $16,000 or more. </p>\n<p align=\"center\"># # # </p>\n<p>&#160; </p>\n</body>\n", "href": "press2004/20040730nfq2.html", "date": "07/30/2004", "pdf": null, "title": "Campaigns Cited for Failure to File July Quarterly Report", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
