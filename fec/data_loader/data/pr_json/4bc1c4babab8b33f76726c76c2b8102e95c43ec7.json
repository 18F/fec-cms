This brings\n    to 46 the total number of cases released thus far. The program&#146;s goal is to expedite\n    resolution of some enforcement matters, reduce the cost of processing complaints, and\n    enhance overall FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available\n    in the FEC&#146;s Press and Public Records offices.<p>For a case to be considered for ADR\n    treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to\n    set aside the statute of limitations while the case is pending in the ADR Office, and\n    agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if necessary, mediation.</p>\n    <p>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching an expedient resolution\n    with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both satisfying to the respondent(s) and in\n    compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions reached through\n    direct and, when necessary, mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for\n    final approval. If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds\n    by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved through ADR are\n    not precedential.</p>\n    <p align=\"RIGHT\">&#160;</p>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"9\" width=\"100%\">\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">1.</th>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">ADR #070</th>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">RESPONDENT:</th>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">Meeks for Congress 2000</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">SOURCE:</th>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">FEC Initiated (Audit)</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">SUBJECT:</th>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">Failure to provide contributor information</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT:</th>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">$3,500 civil penalty*<p>Respondent agrees to\n        amend reports previously filed with the Commission; use a computer program to note and\n        record name, address, occupation and employer of each contributor and to advise\n        contributors when the above information is missing; train new committee staff in the\n        reporting requirements of the FECA and regulations and to subsequently enroll, during the\n        next 15 months, new staff in Commission sponsored seminar for campaign committees; and\n        designate a Committee staff member as the individual responsible for FEC compliance.</p></td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <th width=\"5%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n        <th width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n        <td width=\"65%\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"/>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"100%\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n"}
