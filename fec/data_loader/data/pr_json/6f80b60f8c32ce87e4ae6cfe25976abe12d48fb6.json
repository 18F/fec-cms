This represented 31 percent of all contributions, up from 29 percent in 2005.&#160; Campaign contributions by candidates themselves totaled $28.1 million or six percent of all funds raised.</p>\n              <p>The attached tables display receipts of Congressional campaigns in the 2008 cycle and include comparisons for the past seven election cycles.&#160; Also provided are financial totals for specific Senate candidates from 2003 to 2007 and House candidates for 2007.&#160; </p>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
