This represents a decline of 9% in receipts\n    and 10% in disbursements over the comparable period in 2000.<p>Senate candidates\n    participating in the 2002 general election raised $257.6 million and spent $225.9 million\n    between January 1, 2001 and October 16, 2002. These totals represent declines of 21% in\n    receipts and 24% in spending since 2000, in spite of the intense competition between the\n    two major parties for control of the Senate. Unlike 2000, competitive Senate campaigns\n    tend to be in smaller population states this year, and there haven&#146;t been specific\n    campaigns reaching the extraordinary levels of spending reached by John Corzine in 2000.</p>\n    <p>Financial activity of House candidates is little changed overall from the 2000 election\n    cycle, with general election candidates raising $470.3 million (less than 1% below 2000\n    totals) and spending $391.5 million thus far in the 2001-2002 cycle (2% higher than in\n    2000). Increases are limited to the 45 open seat races to be decided on November 5. While\n    reapportionment and redistricting after the 2000 census have led to more open seats than\n    in 2000, there are far fewer in this cycle than in 1992 after the last census. Tables on\n    median House activity and the number of nonincumbent candidates at various levels of\n    activity are included here and provide evidence of the small number of House races with\n    large financial totals.</p>\n    <p>Tables accompanying this release offer summary data for Senate and House candidates by\n    political party, as well as by candidate status (incumbent, challenger, or open seat).\n    Also included are rankings of Senate and House candidates for the following categories:\n    receipts, individual contributions, PAC and other committee contributions, disbursements,\n    cash-on-hand, and debts owed. Six-year financial summaries of Senate candidates in 2002,\n    as well as current cycle financial summaries for each House general election campaign are\n    also attached. </p>\n    <p>This release and the data contained in it are also available on the FEC&#146;s web site\n    at <a href=\"../../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> under News Releases or Campaign\n    Finance Reports and Data.</p>\n    <hr/>\n    <p class=\"bold\">Tables</p>\n    <p>The files marked [EXCEL] can be viewed using Microsoft Excel available from Microsoft\n    at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\">http://www.microsoft.com</a> or using the free\n    Microsoft Excel 97/2000 Viewer available from Microsoft at <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/xlviewer.aspx\">http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/xlviewer.aspx</a>.</p><ul>\n      <li>General Election Campaign Summary Through October 16,2002 [<a href=\"cansum11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Senate Financial Summary Through Pre-Election Period 1992-2002 [<a href=\"sensum11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>House Financial Summary Through Pre-Election Period 1992-2002 [<a href=\"hsesum11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Median Activity for House Campaigns [<a href=\"hsemedian11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Financial Activity of House Nonincumbent Candidates [<a href=\"hsenoninc11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Campaign Summary for All Campaigns Through September 30, 2002 [<a href=\"cansumq311_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Six Year Totals for Senate Campaigns [<a href=\"sen611_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Top 50 Senate General Election Campaigns [<a href=\"sen50spre11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Top 50 House General Election Campaigns [<a href=\"hse50spre11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Top 50 House General Election Incumbent Campaigns [<a href=\"hseinc50spre11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Top 50 House General Election Challenger Campaigns [<a href=\"hsechl50spre11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Top 50 House General Election Open Seat Campaigns [<a href=\"hseopn50spre11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Financial Activity of House General Election Candidates [<a href=\"houselist11_01.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n    </ul>\n    <hr/>\n    <p class=\"bold\">Footnotes:</p>\n    <p><small>1.
