Those committees that did not file on the due date were sent notification on October 22, 2012 that their reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n        <p>As of November 1, 2012, the required Pre-General disclosure report had not been received from:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Robert Tillman for Congress (KS/04)</li>\n          <li>Jose Peixoto for US Congress (FL/26)</li>\n          <li>Concepcion for US Congress 2012 (IL/04)</li>\n          <li>Rex Bell for Congress (IN/06)</li>\n          <li>Committee to Elect Dan Fishman (MA/06)</li>\n          <li>Committee to Elect Wendy Rosen for Congress (MD/01)</li>\n          <li>Friends of Cobby M.

If sent by certified or registered mail, the report should have been postmarked by October 22, 2012. </p>\n        <p>The Commission notified committees of their potential pre-general filing requirements on October 1, 2012. Those committees that did not file on the due date were sent notification on October 26, 2012 that their reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n        <p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal campaign finance law, even though their names may appear on state ballots. If an individual raises or spends $5,000 or less, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the Act.</p>\n        <p>Other political committees that support Senate and House candidates in elections, but are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign, are also required to file quarterly reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n        <p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions, and the FEC has implemented an Administrative Fine program with provisions for assessing monetary penalties. </p>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. </em></p>\n        <p align=\"center\"/>\n        <p align=\"center\"># # #</p>\n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"100%\" valign=\"top\"><p>&#160;</p>\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n        <p align=\"center\">&#160;      </p></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n"}
