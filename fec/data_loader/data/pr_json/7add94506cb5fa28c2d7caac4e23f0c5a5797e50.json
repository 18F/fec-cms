The response stated during the course of Senator Smith&#8217;s two elections in the 1996 election cycle he loaned his committee approximately $2.3 million and Senator Smith had over time personally repaid the bank loans in full. According to the response, one of the loans the candidate made to his campaign in 1996 was for approximately $1.6 million, and that as a result of the candidate&#8217;s periodic payments, the outstanding balance on the debt to U.S. Bankcorp was $589.321. The response further maintains that the Senator and his wife took out and received a home equity loan valued at $1.7 million and asserted the Senator used $589.321of the proceeds to retire the U.S. Bankcorp loan and did not exceed his share of the value of the home he jointly owned with his wife. Based on this information the Commission found no reason to believe that the Committee, the Senator or his wife violated the law with respect to the home loan. However, in the response the Committee acknowledged that it had originally failed to report many payments made to pay off the 1995 line of credit including the last payment and that it had not reported that of portion a the 2000 home equity loan had been used to make the final repayment on the line of credit. The Commission conciliated with the Committee with respect to the reporting problems.</p>\n            <p>The complaint in MUR 5299 asserted that U.S. Bankcorp extended a $2 million uncollateralized line of credit to Senator Smith and his committee in 1995, with an allegedly lower interest rate than extended to other borrowers. The Commission decided to take no action with respect to MUR 5299, because the original 1995 loan, the draw-downs from which were completed in 1996, was made more than eight years ago, nearly seven years before the complaint was filed and after the statute of limitations had expired.&#160; </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5299 or 5322 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>3.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5548&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5548</a> </strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a) The Committee on Arrangements for the 2004 Republican National Convention; Mike Retzer, treasurer</p>\n          (b) Republican National Committee, Mike Retzer, treasurer </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p> Jerry H.

The complainant alleged these social activities were the functional equivalent of fundraising events and the fees that the donors and fundraisers paid to attend them were excessive and prohibited contributions to respondents in violation the Act. Respondents counter that LogiCom organized, marketed and provided these activities directly to interested individuals, that the events were not fundraisers and that any activity fees paid to that company were not contributions and were not reportable to the Commission. The Commission found no reason to believe, based upon the complaint&#8217;s unsubstantiated allegations weighed against the response by the RNC and Convention committees. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5548 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.
