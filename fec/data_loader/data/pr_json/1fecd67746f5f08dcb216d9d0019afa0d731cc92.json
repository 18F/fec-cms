S. House of Representatives.</p>\n    <p>As of 5 p.m., May 14, 2002, a disclosure report from the following committee had not\n    been filed:</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p><strong>UT......CRAIG AXFORD FOR CONGRESS COMMITTEE...MICHAEL MIELKE, TREAS...CRAIG P.\n      AXFORD...GRN</strong></p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>Reports were due May 6, 2002, and should have included financial activity for the\n    period April 1, 2002, through April 28, 2002. If sent by certified or registered mail, the\n    reports should have been postmarked by midnight May 3, 2002. Mandatory electronic filing\n    requirements became effective as of January 1, 2001. Any committee that receives\n    contributions or makes expenditures in excess of $50,000 in the current calendar year, or\n    that reasonably expects to do so, must submit its reports electronically. These rules\n    became effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2001.</p>\n    <p>Committees were notified of their filing requirements on April 12, 2002. Those\n    committees which did not file on the due date were notified on May 7, 2002, that reports\n    had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond\n    within four business days. </p>\n    <p>The Commission publishes only the names of those committees which have been designated\n    by candidates as their principal campaign committees. Other political committees\n    supporting Senate and House candidates (those which are not authorized units of a\n    candidate's campaign) file either quarterly or monthly reports. Those committees are not\n    published by the FEC.</p>\n    <p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers falls under the\n    Administrative Fine Program. Political committees and treasurers who fail to file their\n    reports on time may be subject to civil money penalties ranging from $125 to $16,000 (or\n    more for repeat late- and non-filers).</p>\n    <p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure report for these congressional committees will\n    be the quarterly report due July 15, 2002. It will cover activity from April 29 through\n    June 30.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"100%\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n"}
