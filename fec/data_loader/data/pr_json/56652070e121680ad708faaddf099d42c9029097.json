On February 2, the Commission concluded that New Mexico Voices for Children&#8217;s proposed severance payment to its former Executive Director, who is currently a candidate for federal office, will not result in a prohibited corporate contribution to the candidate under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) or Commission regulations because the severance payment would be made irrespective of the individual&#8217;s candidacy for Congress. </p>\n        <p><strong><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=ao&amp;AO=3391&amp;START=1192814.pdf\">AO 2011-28 (Western Representation PAC)</a></strong>. On February 2, the Commission concluded that Western Representation PAC may not exclude the costs of independent expenditure advertisements placed on Facebook from the calculation of expenses included on its 24- and 48-hour reports. The Commission concluded further that Western Representation PAC must attribute the monthly cost of these independent expenditure advertisements to various states&#8217; Presidential primary elections on Western Representation PAC&#8217;s regular monthly reports.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">AO 2011-24 (StandLouder.com)</a></strong>. On February 3, the Commission concluded that StandLouder.com may create an independent expenditure-only committee for the purpose of accepting advertisement content, receiving contributions, and funding independent expenditures. The Commission did not reach a consensus by four votes on a response to questions concerning 1) StandLouder.com&#8217;s political committee status, 2) the collective political committee status of StandLouder.com, the content creators, and the funders of the advertisements, and 3) the disclaimer and disclosure obligations that apply to the proposed advertisements. The LLC plans to establish a web application through the website StandLouder.com that will allow users to post and fund proposed advertisements. In its advisory opinion request, StandLouder.com indicates that it will receive a license from content creators to, among other services, facilitate funding, provide technical compliance, and determine the time and placement of the ads. StandLouder.com anticipates that the advertisements will relate to topics including political and social issues as well as candidates for federal office. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>Advisory Opinions and Requests are available through the <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">Advisory Opinions search page</a> in the Law and Regulations section of the Commission website. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public two closed cases.</p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6417</a></strong> <br/>\n        RESPONDENTS:&#160; Jim Huffman for Senate and Lisa Lisker, in her official capacity as treasurer; James Huffman; and Leslie Spencer<br/>\n        COMPLAINANT:&#160; Democratic Party of Oregon<br/>\n        SUBJECT:&#160; The complaint alleged that Jim Huffman for Senate and Lisker, in her official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) and Huffman reported the receipt of six loans from Huffman&#8217;s personal funds that were not from his personal funds because, based on Huffman&#8217;s personal financial disclosure statement, Huffman did not have sufficient personal funds to make the loans. As a result, the complaint alleged that the Committee accepted, and the source of the funds made, an excessive contribution. Huffman was a 2010 candidate for Oregon&#8217;s U.S. Senate seat. <br/>\n        DISPOSITION: The Commission found reason to believe Spencer, Huffman's spouse, &#160;made and the Committee and Huffman accepted excessive contributions. The Commission entered into a conciliation agreement whereby the Committee, Huffman and Spencer agreed to pay a civil penalty of $29,900.</p>\n        <p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6453</a></strong> <br/>\n  RESPONDENTS:&#160; Missouri Association of Realtors, Missouri Association of Realtors Issues Mobilization Political Action Committee<br/>\n  COMPLAINANT:&#160; Paul N. Sidio<br/>\n  SUBJECT:&#160; The complaint alleged that the Missouri Association of Realtors (MAR), a 501(c)(6) trade association, used its trade association dues assessments to fund its separate segregated fund, the Issues Mobilization Political Action Committee (IMPAC). <br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe MAR or IMPAC violated the Act because while MAR may have collected money to fund IMPAC, IMPAC is not a federal political committee and these funds did not appear to be &#8220;contributions&#8221; as defined by the Act because they do not appear to have been used for the purpose of influencing a federal election.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>For information regarding the above matters, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.</p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><strong>LITIGATION</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><a href=\"../../law/litigation/Tisdale.shtml\"><em>Tisdale v.
