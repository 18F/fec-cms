On May 10, the Commission concluded that two of Free Speech's 11 proposed ads would expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified Federal candidate, four of the proposed ads would not be express advocacy ads, and two of the four proposed donation requests would not be solicitations under the Act. The Commission could not approve a response by the required four affirmative votes about the remaining ads or donation requests, or about Free Speech's status as a political committee. Statements were issued by <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1209339.pdf\">Chair Caroline C. Hunter and Commissioners Donald F. McGahn and Matthew S. Petersen</a>, and by <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1209340.pdf\">Vice Chair Ellen L. Weintraub and Commissioners Cynthia L. Bauerly and Steven T.

The Commission further concluded that the Firm&#8217;s partners, associates, and other employees, individually, may volunteer time in the form of legal or other services to the Committee in accordance with a letter of agreement without the Firm inadvertently providing the Committee a prohibited in-kind contribution. The letter of agreement, in part, addresses the conditions under which the Firm&#8217;s partners, associates, and other employees, individually and independently, may volunteer their time to the Committee.&#160; <br/>\n            <u> </u></p>\n        <p><u>Advisory Opinions Considered</u></p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=ao&amp;AO=3428\"><strong>AOR 2012-07 (Feinstein for Senate)</strong></a>. On May 10, the Commission discussed and voted on two draft advisory opinions, based on a request from Feinstein for Senate, but did not reach consensus. The Committee asked the Commission whether the donors who attempted to contribute to the Committee, but whose funds were embezzled by its treasurer Kinde Durkee, may make replacement contributions to the Committee without the attempted contributions counting against the donors' per election limits. The Commission directed the Office of General Counsel to prepare and circulate a revised draft advisory opinion reflecting areas of consensus for a future Commission vote. During the discussion, the Commission heard from counsel on behalf of Feinstein for Senate.</p>\n        <p><strong><u><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">AOR 2012-08 (Repledge)</a></u></strong>. On May 10, the Commission discussed and voted on two draft advisory opinions, based on a request from Repledge, but did not reach consensus on either draft. Repledge asked a number of questions relating to its proposed plan to establish a web-based platform allowing supporters of opposing federal candidates to redirect potential contributions to charitable organizations, &#160;including whether Repledge would (1) receive contributions, (2) have the major purpose of influencing a federal election, and (3) violate the prohibition on corporate contributions to candidates.During the discussion, the Commission heard from the requestor. </p>\n        <p><u/></p>\n        <p><u>Comments</u></p>\n        <p><u/></p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1206315.pdf\"><strong>AOR 2012-17 (Red Blue T LLC, ArmourMedia, Inc., and m-Qube, Inc.)</strong></a>. On May 9, the Commission received a <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1209376.pdf\">comment</a> on Advisory Opinion Request 2012-17 (Red Blue T LLC, ArmourMedia, Inc., and m-Qube, Inc.). The requestors ask whether their proposal to use mobile phone text messaging to raise funds for political committees is permissible under the Act and Commission regulations. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1208136.pdf\"><strong>AOR 2012-19 (American Future Fund)</strong></a>. On May 10, the Commission made public a <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1209400.pdf\">comment</a> on Advisory Opinion Request 2012-19 (American Future Fund). American Future Fund is a 501(c)(4) organization that intends to produce and distribute certain broadcast advertisements. It asks whether any of its proposed advertisements constitute electioneering communications.</p>\n        <p><u/></p>\n        <p><u>Requests Received</u></p>\n        <p><u/></p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1209199.pdf\"><strong>AOR 2012-20 (Mullin)</strong></a>. On May 7, the Commission made public Advisory Opinion Request 2012-20. The requestor is a candidate for Congress from Oklahoma, and also the President and CEO of Mullin Plumbing, Inc. and Mullin Plumbing West Division, Inc. (the companies).&#160; Markwayne Mullin has appeared in television and radio commercials and a weekly radio program for the companies for years. Mullin asks whether his appearance in the commercials and the radio program are electioneering communications and, if so, whether, when he files reports for the companies, he would be required to disclose the names and addresses of customers who paid $1,000 or more for services. The Commission will accept written comments on the request during the 10-day period following publication of the request (no later than May 17, 2012) and must issue a response no later than 20 days after receipt of the complete request, specifically by May 24, 2012.</p>\n        <p>  Advisory Opinions and Requests are available through the <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">Advisory Opinions search page</a> in the Law and Regulations section of the Commission website. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong><br/>\n            <br/>\n  The Commission made public two closed cases.

Womack&#8217;s name on a fundraiser invitation without the approval of Steve Womack for Congress and Eldredge, in his official capacity as treasurer.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe that AHLPAC had fraudulently represented itself as speaking on behalf of Rep. Womack because the identification of Rep. Womack as a fundraiser co-host on an invitation sent by AHLPAC appears to have been a mistake rather than a fraudulent scheme to raise donations. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\"><strong>MUR 6517</strong></a><strong><br/>\n          </strong>RESPONDENTS: Gary Kenneth King; and King for Congress (Terminated)<br/>\n  COMPLAINANT:&#160; Bruce Malott<br/>\n  SUBJECT:&#160; The complaint alleged that King and King for Congress (the Committee) (1) continued to file reports with the Commission, using Malott&#8217;s electronic signature as Committee treasurer, even though Malott had orally notified King of his resignation, (2) failed to file an amended Statement of Organization naming a new treasurer and (3) made campaign expenditures while the treasurer position was vacant. <br/>\n  DISPOSITION:&#160; The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the matter in light of the fact that the King for Congress was terminated and thus is no longer an existing reporting entity under the Act.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>AUDITS</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><a href=\"../../agenda/2012/mtgdoc_1230.pdf\"><strong>Audit Division Recommendation Memorandum on The Legacy Committee Political Action Committee</strong></a>.

The Audit Division memorandum recommends that the Commission approve the findings presented in the Draft Final Audit Report related to (1) misstatement of financial activity and (2) failure to file notices and properly disclose independent expenditures. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>LITIGATION</strong></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"../../law/litigation/herron.shtml\"><em>Herron for Congress v.
