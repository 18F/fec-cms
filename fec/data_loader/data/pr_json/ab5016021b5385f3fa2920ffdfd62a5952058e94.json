FEC</em></strong> </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>WASHINGTON &#8211; At an open meeting of the Federal Election Commission today, Chairman Steven T. Walther read his <a href=\"../../agenda/2009/statement20090924.pdf\">statement</a> in response to the September 18, 2009 <a href=\"../../law/litigation/emilyslist_08_ac_opinion.pdf\">ruling</a> by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>EMILY&#8217;s List v. FEC.</em></p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>&#8220;The decision raises many complex and procedural issues. The Commission has already received a preliminary briefing from our General Counsel&#8217;s Office and we will receive additional briefings from OGC in the next few weeks. I anticipate that the six of us will engage in some extremely interesting discussions in the weeks to come,&#8221; Walther said in his statement.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>The law provides that a party may seek rehearing of a three-judge panel decision by the full Court of Appeals. The Commission has 45 days from the decision to seek such a rehearing by the full Court of Appeals.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>&#8220;As soon as the Commission reaches a decision on what steps it will take, we will announce that decision publicly and, at that time, provide as much information and guidance as we can to the regulated community,&#8221; Walther said.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><em/></p>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
