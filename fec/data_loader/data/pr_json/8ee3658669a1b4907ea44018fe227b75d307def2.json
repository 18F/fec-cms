Phillips<br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: Heidi for Texas Campaign, Inc.; and Heidi Thiess<br/>\n          SUBJECT:&#160; The complaint alleged that Heidi for Texas Campaign, Inc. (the Committee) funded communications in the form of emails in behalf of several federal candidates and did not include a proper disclaimer. The complaint also alleged that the Committee failed to disclose related contributions and expenditures to the Commission. Thiess was a 2012 state candidate for representative of Texas&#8217;s 24th state district. <br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe that the Committee and Thiess failed to include disclaimers because the emails at issue are not &#8220;public communications,&#8221; did not require disclaimers and did not need to be financed with funds subject to the limitations, prohibitions and reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended. The Commission further found no reason to believe that the Committee and Thiess failed to file independent expenditure notices because the available information indicates that any costs associated with the emails at issue were not in excess of the applicable reporting threshold.</p>\n          <p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FINES</strong></p>\n          <p/>\n          <p>The Commission made public three campaign finance enforcement matters that were resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program, as follows.
