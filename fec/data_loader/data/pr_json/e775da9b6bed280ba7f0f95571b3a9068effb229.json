Other requirements to be declared \n    eligible include agreeing to an overall spending limit, abiding by spending \n    limits in each state, using public funds only for legitimate \n    campaign-related expenses, keeping financial records and permitting an \n    extensive campaign audit. </p>\n    <p>Based on documents filed by the Clark campaign on November 6, 2003, \n    contributions from the following states were verified for threshold \n    purposes: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of \n    Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, \n    Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, \n    Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p>\n    <p>Once declared eligible, campaigns may submit additional contributions for \n    matching funds on the first business day of every month. The U.S. Treasury \n    Department will pay the FEC-certified amounts beginning in January 2004. The \n    maximum amount a candidate could receive is currently estimated to be $18.6 \n    million.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # # </p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n"}
