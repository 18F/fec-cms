Norton, the Commission&#8217;s General Counsel.</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">If an organization receives contributions or make expenditures in excess of $1,000, and its major purpose is involvement in campaign activity, it must register with the Commission and abide by the contribution restrictions and reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act.&#160; Each of these entities registered with the Internal Revenue Service as &#8220;Section 527&#8221; organizations &#8211; tax exempt groups whose function is to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to Federal, State, or local public office or office in a political organization, or the election of Presidential electors.</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">Through their public statements, solicitations for contributions, and various communications to the public, these organizations clearly established that they were political committees during the 2004 campaign.&#160; Their failure to register with the Commission, abide by contribution limits and prohibitions, and file disclosure reports resulted in the organizations agreeing to pay the following civil penalties:</p>\n      <p align=\"left\"/>\n      <div align=\"left\">\n        <ul>\n          <li><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocs/00005905.pdf\">League of Conservation Voters 527 and 527II</a> -- $180,000</li>\n            <li><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocs/000058F4.pdf\">MoveOn.org Voter Fund</a> -- $ 150,000</li>\n            <li><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocs/000058ED.pdf\">Swiftboat Veterans and POWs for Truth</a> -- $ 299,500</li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>      \n      <p align=\"left\"/>\n      <p align=\"left\">The organizations also agreed to cease and desist from violating applicable laws and regulations and to file reports with the Commission for the relevant periods containing all of the information that must be disclosed by federal political committees.</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">Among other spending in the 2004 election, the League of Conservation Voters 527 groups funded door-to-door and phone canvassing activities that expressly advocated the election of Senator Kerry and the defeat of President Bush.&#160; MoveOn.org Voter Fund produced television advertisements targeted to Presidential battleground states aimed at defeating George W. Bush, and its solicitations for funds clearly indicated that the funds received would be used to defeat President Bush in the 2004 general election.&#160; Swiftboat Veterans and POWs for Truth produced advertisements and sent out direct mail that attacked John Kerry and expressly advocated his defeat. </p>\n      <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">Case Summaries:</p>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5511&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR</a></strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5511&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong> 5511</strong></a><strong> <a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5525&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">&amp; 5525</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160; Swift Boat Vets and POWs for Truth [5511 &amp; 5525]</p>\n              <p>(b)&#160; Bush-Cheney &#8217;04, Inc., David Herndon, treasurer [5525]</p>\n              <p>(c)&#160;&#160; Alachua County Republican Party [5525]</p>\n              <p>(d)&#160; Republican National Committee, Mike Retzner, treasurer &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; [5525]</p>\n              <p>(e)&#160; George W.
