According to the Audit Report the committee failed to accurately disclose operating expenditures which resulted from an embezzlement scheme perpetrated by Kenneth Phelps.&#160; The committee also failed to maintain payroll deduction authorization forms. The RAD report referred apparent reporting violations stemming from the committee&#8217;s failure to disclose certain receipts. The Commission found no reason to believe with regard to the committee&#8217;s failure to maintain payroll deduction records, because the policy on payroll deduction authorization forms had changed and the committee was not given the opportunity to demonstrate compliance under the new policy. The Commission reached a conciliation agreement with the Lockheed Martin PAC regarding the other reporting matters. Two Statements of Reasons were issued, one by Chairman Toner and Commissioner Mason, and a second by Chairman Toner, Vice Chairman Lenhard and Commissioners Mason, Walther, Weintraub and von Spakovsky. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5721 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>2.</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5636&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5636</a></strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"104\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"391\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Russ Diamond</p>\n            (b)&#160;&#160; russdiamond.org and Lori Kimmel, treasurer (state &#160;&#160;&#160; committee) </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"104\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"391\" valign=\"top\"><p> Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"104\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"391\" valign=\"top\"><p> Failure to file Statement of Candidacy; failure to register and report; use of non-federal (state) funds for a federal election  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>DISPOSITION:</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Reason to believe, but took no further action*[re: failure to file Statement of Candidacy; failure to register and report; use of non-federal (state) funds for  a federal election]</p>\n            <p>(b)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Reason to believe, but took no further action*[re: use of non-federal (state) funds for a federal election]</p>\n            <p>(a-b)&#160; Sent admonishment letters.</p>\n            <p/>\n            The complaint alleged that Russ Diamond was a candidate for Federal office for Pennsylvania&#8217;s 17th District in the 2004 election and failed to register a political committee and file disclosure reports. Mr. Diamond claimed that he never accepted more than $5,000 in contributions or made more than $5,000 in expenditures, and therefore never qualified as a candidate under the Act. &#160;Mr. Diamond admitted, however, to paying for filing fees, flyers, a pro-rated Federal portion of his campaign&#8217;s shared website, and use of office space and equipment of his business for his federal campaign, all of which may have totaled more than $5,000. The Commission found reason to believe the law may have been violated, but determined that further investigation would be needed to learn the extent of any violation. Based on the Commission&#8217;s priorities and resources relative to other pending matters, it decided to take no further action and send admonishment letters. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"104\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"391\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering \n\n\n5636 \n\n under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>3.</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5699&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5699</a></strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; New York Senate 2000, Andrew Grossman, treasurer</p>\n            <p>(b)&#160;&#160; Friends of Hillary, John F.X.
