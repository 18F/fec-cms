FEC</strong> </strong></p>\n              <p align=\"center\"/>\n              <p>WASHINGTON &#8211; The Federal Election Commission (FEC/the Commission) will conduct a public hearing on Wednesday and Thursday, October 17-18, as part of a rulemaking to incorporate the Supreme Court&#8217;s recent decision in Wisconsin Right to Life v. FEC into the Commission&#8217;s regulations. </p>\n              <p>The FEC approved a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on August 23, 2007, seeking comment from the public on the implementation of the Court&#8217;s decision, which held that certain advertisements were entitled to an exemption from the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act&#8217;s (BCRA) restriction on the use of corporate or union funds for &#8220;electioneering communications.&#8221;&#160; The Supreme Court held that the specific ads at issue in the case were not the &#8220;functional equivalent of express advocacy&#8221; because they were &#8220;susceptible of a reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a clearly identified Federal candidate.&#8221;</p>\n              <p>The NPRM sought comment on a number of questions, including whether ads entitled to exemption under the proposed rule would need to be disclosed to the FEC.&#160; The NPRM also asked questions related to the specific criteria of the exemption (i.e., what types of ads should be eligible) and how the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision might impact other aspects of campaign finance regulation.&#160; <a href=\"../../pdf/nprm/electioneering_comm/2007/ec07nprmcomments.shtml\">Written comments submitted in response to the Commission&#8217;s NPRM can be found on the Commission's website</a>. </p>\n              <p>The hearing will take place at the Commission&#8217;s offices at 999 E Street N.W. in Washington, and will begin at 10:00 am both days.&#160;
