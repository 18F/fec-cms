The Caucus also violated the law by receiving an \n            excessive contribution from one contributor in 2002. Finally, the \n            Caucus violated the Act by making a series of impermissible transfers \n            from its non-federal account to its federal account. The Commission \n            found no reason to believe that the Caucus and the Party violated \n            the Act with regard to transfers between the two committees. The Commission \n            found reason to believe the Party committee violated the Act by receiving \n            excessive contributions but decided to take no further action and \n            send an admonishment letter. The Commission found reason to believe \n            against two individuals for making excessive contributions but decided \n            to take no further action and send admonishment letters. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td><p>Documents from these matters are available from the Commission's \n              web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering 5349 \n              under case number.
