PAC money totaled $14.3 million and represented 19% of\n    receipts.</p>\n    <p>While comparisons of Senate races are problematic because of their diversity, mid-year\n    reports filed by this current class of 63 candidates indicate more fundraising activity\n    than the first six-month filings by candidates in the past three election cycles. By\n    comparison, for the first six months in 1997, the last election cycle for the present\n    group of 34 Senate seats, 58 candidates reported raising $42.6 million and spending $10.8\n    million. During the first half of 1999, 73 candidates competing for 33 Senate seats in\n    2000 raised $50 million and spent $12.2 million. In 2001, 56 candidates, competing for 33\n    seats, raised $43 million and spent $9.3 million. </p>\n    <p>Candidates ended the first six months of 2003 with $114.6 million cash-on-hand and\n    debts of $17.4 million, some of which is from previous elections. </p>\n    <p>The attached pages provide summary statistical information on each candidate.
