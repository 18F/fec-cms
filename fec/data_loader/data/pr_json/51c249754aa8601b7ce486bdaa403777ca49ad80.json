Bush -Cheney 2000, Inc. has agreed \n      to pay a $90,000 civil penalty.<br/>\n    <br/>\n      According to the conciliation agreement, Bush - Cheney 2000 held a bank \n      account designated Bush-Cheney 2000, Inc. -Media. After the November 7, \n      2000 presidential election, the Committee redesignated this bank account \n      Bush-Cheney 2000, Inc. - Recount Fund and used the account to raise funds \n      and pay costs associated with the recount. However, the Committee failed \n      to include that activity in disclosure reports filed with the Commission. \n      <br/>\n    <br/>\n    The Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act) requires authorized committees \n    of candidates for federal office to report the total amount of all receipts \n    of disbursements in committee accounts, and to itemize them when the \n    aggregate amount or value exceeds $200 in an election cycle. In Advisory \n    Opinions 1998-26 and 1978-92, the Commission held that while separate \n    organizations established solely to fund a recount effort would not be \n    required to file disclosure reports, a federal political committee \n    establishing a bank account for recount purposes must report those receipts \n    and disbursements. <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Filings submitted to the IRS in 2002 and 2003 suggest the recount account \n    raised approximately $11 million and spent approximately $13 million.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    Bush- Cheney 2000 admitted that the failure to report the receipts and \n    disbursements associated with its recount activity and to properly itemize \n    them as ?other receipts? and ?other disbursements? violated the Act. The \n    committee agreed to cease and desist from violating these sections of the \n    Act and agreed to submit a miscellaneous filing to the FEC that discloses \n    and itemizes, where appropriate, its recount receipts and disbursements.<br/>\n    <br/>\n    The investigation stemmed from a complaint filed by Terence R. McAuliffe, \n    Chairman of the Democratic National Committee.<br/>\n&#160;<table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n      <tr>\n          <td valign=\"TOP\">1.&#160;<a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5199&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR&#160;5199</a></td>\n        <td valign=\"TOP\">RESPONDENTS: \n        </td>\n        <td valign=\"TOP\">Bush-Cheney 2000, Inc., David Herndon, treasurer \n        </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        <td valign=\"TOP\">COMPLAINANT:</td>\n        <td valign=\"TOP\">Terence R.
