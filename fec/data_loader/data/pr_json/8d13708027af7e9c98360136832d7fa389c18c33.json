The ADR program expedites resolution of enforcement matters and reduces the cost of processing complaints. </p>\n      <p>For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is being resolved, and participate in mediation if necessary.</p>\n      <p>The ADR process is designed to reach an expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act.&#160; Resolutions reached through direct and, when necessary, mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval.&#160; Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available in the FEC&#8217;s Press and Public Records office. </p>\n      <p/>\n      <p/>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"36\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"147\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=243&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">ADR 243</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"343\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"36\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"147\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"343\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"36\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"147\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"343\" valign=\"top\"><p> Patlak for Congress, Jame S.

However, in order to comply with Audit&#8217;s recommendations, the Committee refunded to contributors $14,140 from the campaign account. In order to conclude this matter, Respondents agrees to provide copies of checks for the $14,140 refunded to contributors and bank statements confirming that the checks have been processed; provide copies of check for approximately $4,760 made payable to the remaining contributors from the Candidate&#8217;s personal account and of bank statements confirming the processing of the aforementioned checks and file for termination.  </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD: </strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at http://www.fec.gov by entering 309 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FECs Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>      \n      <p align=\"center\">###</p>\n    </td></tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "press2006/20060614adr.html", "date": "06/14/2006", "pdf": null, "title": "ADR Programs Resolves Cases", "category": "Enforcement Matters"}
