The complainant stated that the &#8220;decision making table&#8221; of the manual demonstrates that the Democratic Party, Democratic candidates and non-committee entities coordinated their efforts, plans, strategies and spending. The manual also lays out &#8220;Vote Goals &amp; Targeting,&#8221; which included plans for a paid and volunteer phone calls and paid statewide mailings, paid early voter motivation efforts and absentee voting programs.&#160; The complaint also described some activity as being funded with 100% nonfederal funds, &#8220;the exact type of spending that federal candidates and officeholders and national political party officials are now prohibited form being involved in.&#8221; The FDP and DNC each responded that the complaint fails to allege specific actions on the part of respondents that would constitute violations of the Act. The FDP and DNC added that the manual is a plan of activities to be undertaken and paid for by the FDP itself, and that the complaint does not refer to any communications, or activity of any kind, that was paid for by any other entity other than the FDP itself. Further, the FDP and DNC both responded that there were never any pages of the manual detailing any &#8220;field help&#8221; to be provided by any of the entities listed on the signature page. Based on the complaint and review of the responses and public information, the Commission found no reason to believe and closed the file with regard to the respondents.&#160; </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5586 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>2.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5613&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5613 </a> </strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p> Massachusetts Republican State Congressional Committee, Brent Anderson, treasurer </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p> Thomas P.

Also, the complaint alleged that the Respondent failed to itemize disbursements. In response, the Respondent stated the complainant was incorrect in his premise that there is a specialized fund for candidates for the U.S. Congress when in fact it is a general account that can be used for any or all federal purposes. Also, the Act does not require a state party committee to support a specific candidate&#8217;s campaign efforts with its funds. The Commission&#8217;s review the 2003-2004 reports did not reveal any disbursements that were required to be itemized. The Commision found no reason to believe the Respondent violated the Act and closed the file. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"32\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"131\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"363\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5613 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.
