The committee treasurer is Sue Peachey.</li>\n                <li>Betts for Congress, principal campaign committee for Donald Betts, Jr., a candidate in Kansas&#8217; 4th district. The committee treasurer is Thomas M. Warner, Jr.</li>\n                <li>Jack Hoogendyk for US Senate, principal campaign committee for Jack Hoogendyk, a candidate in Michigan. The committee treasurer is Jack Hoogendyk.</li>\n                <li>Allen for Congress, principal campaign committee for Joseph William Allen, a candidate in Missouri&#8217;s 8th district. The committee treasurer is Kathryn Sunita Allen.</li>\n              </ul>\n              <p>The reports were due on July 24, 2008. If sent by certified or registered mail, the report should have been postmarked by July 21, 2008.</p>\n              <p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state ballots. If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the Act.</p>\n              <p>The FEC notified committees involved in these primaries of their potential filing requirements on June 30, 2008. Those committees who did not file on the due date were notified on<strong> </strong>July 25, 2008 that reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n              <p>Other political committees that support Senate and House candidates in elections, but are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign are also required to file pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n              <p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions, and the FEC has implemented an administrative fine program with provisions for assessing monetary penalties.</p>\n              <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
