This hearing was among the new procedural rules the Commission approved this year in order to promote transparency and fairness during the audit process and allow the Commission an opportunity to ask relevant questions directly to the audited committee prior to adopting a final audit report. Today&#8217;s hearing highlights the results of a lengthy Commission exchange with the public on ways to provide more clarity and opportunities for committees to respond during the enforcement process. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>At the open meeting, Counsel for the Tennessee Democratic Party appeared before the Commission to address the proposed findings in the FEC Audit Division&#8217;s <a href=\"../../agenda/2009/mtgdoc0970.pdf\">draft final audit report</a>. The Commission will consider today&#8217;s arguments before voting on the final audit report at a later date.</p>\n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"100%\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n                <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
