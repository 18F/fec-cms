The complaint alleged Bad Boy Worldwide Entertainment Group (BBWEG), a for-profit corporation controlled by Mr. Combs, may have underwritten some of Citizen Changes&#8217; political activities. &#160;Citizen Change submitted a detailed response illustrating how it was funded and operated by Mr. Combs, including copies of talking points and speeches used for public appearance and rallies, as well as instructions and scripts provided to celebrity participants. Kerry &#8211; Edwards 2004, Inc. also denied the allegations and argued that their action did not violate the Act.

The complaint further alleges that if the PAC did not pay for the signs, then someone else, including Monty and Kris Warner may have funded the signs and improperly attributed them to the PAC. The PAC was registered with the Commission until December 9, 2004, when it was administratively terminated. Kris Warner acknowledged that he and his wife contributed $7,002.28 to the Northeast Conservative PAC in September 2004. Monty Warner stated that he had no involvement or role whatsoever in the planning, coordination, or production of the Bush/Warner campaign signs and did not authorize the production of these signs. The Commission found reason to believe the PAC may have been violated the law because it appeared that prior to its termination, the PAC received $10,000 from the Warner family during 2004, some or all of which were expended on the yard signs in question, but the committee failed to report these as both a receipts and disbursements and also failed to file any reports for the covered period. The Commission decided to take no further action but sent an admonishment letter warning that any additional Federal activity will void the administrative termination. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"35\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"98\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"393\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering \n\n\n5639 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>3.</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5701&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5701</a></strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Bob Filner for Congress (CA/51), Mark Pollick, treasurer</p>\n            <p>(b)&#160;&#160; Congressman Bob Filner</p>\n            <p>(c)&#160;&#160; Jane Filner</p>\n            (d)&#160;&#160; Campaign Resources </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> Juan Vargas  </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> Personal use of campaign funds  </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>DISPOSITION:</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a-d)&#160; No reason to believe*</p>\n            <p>The complainant alleged that Bob Filner for Congress has been &#8220;diverting&#8221; campaign contribution to Filner&#8217;s wife&#8217;s company, Campaign Resources, and to the Filner household. &#160;The complaint requested an investigation as to whether Jane Filner performed <em>bona fide</em> services to the Filner committee.&#160; The respondents asserted that Jane Filner established her company as a sole proprietorship in Washington D.C. in 1995.
