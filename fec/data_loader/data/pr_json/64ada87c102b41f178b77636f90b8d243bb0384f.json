The revised rules, which are being issued with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), update the Commission&#8217;s regulations to reflect statutory changes enacted after the Standards of Conduct originally were promulgated, and to conform to regulations issued by OGE and the Office of Personnel Management. In addition, new rules supplementing OGE&#8217;s Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch address outside employment of Commissioners and FEC employees. The new rules are effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.</p>\n                <p/></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"100%\" valign=\"top\"><p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
