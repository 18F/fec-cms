In addition, the complaint stated that FTV violated the Act by encouraging foreign nationals to evade the Act&#8217;s restrictions on making contributions. The General Counsel&#8217;s office recommended that the Commission exercise its prosecutorial discretion and dismiss the complaint for lack of sufficient information to support reason to believe findings against the respondents on a coordination theory and foreign national contributions. The Commission voted unanimously to adopt this recommendation. Chairman Thomas, Vice Chairman Toner and Commissioners Mason, McDonald and Weintraub issued a Statement for the Record.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\"><p>Documents from these matters are available from the \n              Commission's web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering \n              5461 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.

The individual Respondents have each repaid Carter&#8217;s for the prior reimbursement of contributions made through their tickets and their spouse&#8217;s tickets to the fundraiser.
