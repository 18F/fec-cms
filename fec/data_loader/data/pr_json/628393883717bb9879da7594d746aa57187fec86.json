This also marks the first time that the public has had the ability to download Senate candidate data electronically. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>&#8220;The FEC&#8217;s Candidate Disbursements tool is part of an ongoing effort to make the FEC website more comprehensive, user-friendly and intuitive, and is another step the agency is taking to make the electoral process more transparent to the American people,&#8221; said Commission Chairman Matthew S. Petersen. </p>\n        <p>The new feature allows users to download itemized disbursements data for a candidate by selecting the appropriate state for Senate candidates and the appropriate state and congressional district for House candidates. Bulk downloads for all House and Senate candidate committees are accessible as well. Files are available in XML and CSV formats and can be found in the Disclosure Database Catalog under the Campaign Finance Reports and Data section of the agency&#8217;s homepage, <a href=\"file:///C:\\Documents%20and%20Settings\\JIngram\\Local%20Settings\\Temp\\notes6030C8\\www.fec.gov\">www.fec.gov</a>.</p>\n        <p>Questions and comments about the website or this new feature can be addressed on the FEC&#8217;s <a href=\"../../blog/\">Disclosure Data blog</a>.</p>        <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>        \n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n            <tr>\n              <td width=\"100%\" valign=\"top\"><p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
