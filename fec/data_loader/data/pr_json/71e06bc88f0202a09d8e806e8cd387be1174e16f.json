This is a 47% increase in receipts for \n    Republicans when compared to the same period in 2001 and a 39% increase for \n    Democrats. When compared to the same period in 1999 &#150; 2000, the last \n    presidential cycle, Republicans registered a 109% increase in receipts, \n    while the Democrats showed a 48% increase.\n    <p>As a result of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), \n    national political parties are no longer permitted to raise soft money. \n    These were funds raised outside the limitations and prohibitions of the \n    Federal Election Campaign Act. During the first six months of 2001, the last \n    election cycle in which national parties were permitted to raise such funds, \n    Democrats raised $37 million in soft money while the Republicans raised \n    $65.5 million. </p>\n    <p>Contributions from individuals constituted the bulk of the receipts for \n    both parties. Democrats reported $42.7 million from individuals and $8.1 \n    million from PACs. Republicans reported $129.1 million from individuals and \n    $6.7 million from PACs. At the end of the reporting period, Democrats had \n    $22.3 million cash on hand and debts of $8 million while Republicans had \n    cash on hand of $42.6 million and debts of $2.8 million. </p>\n    <p>Charts attached to this release provide summary data for the financial \n    activities of the two major parties for the first six months of the 2003 -04 \n    cycle and comparisons for the same period in the previous seven election \n    cycles. Also included is a chart by size of contributions made by \n    individuals to national party committees. </p>\n    <hr/>\n    <p>CHARTS</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p>Republican Party Federal Activity [<a href=\"repfed2003.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n      [<a href=\"repfed2003.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n      <p>Democratic Party Federal Activity [<a href=\"demfed2003.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n      [<a href=\"demfed2003.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n      <p>Individual Contributions to Parties by Size of Contribution &#150; 2003 [<a href=\"ptyindiv.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n      [<a href=\"ptyindiv.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "date": "08/28/2003", "href": "press2003/20030828party/20030828party.html", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries", "title": "FEC Releases 6-Month Fundraising Figures For Parties", "pdf": null}
