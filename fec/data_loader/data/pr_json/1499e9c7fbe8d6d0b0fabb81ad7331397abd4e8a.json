The complaints alleged that disbursements made from the state committee after the date Welch announced his federal candidacy, \n\n\nfor radio advertisements, fundraising and other campaign activities were\n\n made in connection with his federal candidacy. The complaints also alleged that Welch impermissibly transferred $1,000 directly from his state campaign account to his federal account and that a state campaign committee salary payment to the candidate&#8217;s wife was used to fund a subsequent contribution to the federal committee. The Commission found there was no reason to believe that disbursements made by the state committee were for the candidate&#8217;s federal election. The Commission, however, did find reason to believe two transfers of $1,000 each from the state committee to the federal committee were impermissible but due to the amount involved and recognizing that the committee refunded the money, the Commission decided to take no further action and send an admonishment letter. The Commission found there was no reason to believe Jeanne Welch violated the law with regard to the contribution she made to her husband&#8217;s campaign. </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\"><p>Documents from these matters are available from the \n              Commission's web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering \n              5387 or 5446 under case number.
