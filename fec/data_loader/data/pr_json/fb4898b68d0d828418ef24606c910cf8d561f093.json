If an individual raises or spends $5,000 or less, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the Act.</p>\n          <p align=\"left\">The FEC notified committees of their potential filing requirements on March 26, 2010. Those committees that did not file on the due date were notified on April 22, 2010, that their reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n          <p align=\"left\">Other political committees that support Senate and House candidates in elections, but are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign, are also required to file quarterly reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n          <p align=\"left\">Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions, and the FEC has implemented an Administrative Fine program with provisions for assessing monetary penalties. </p>\n          <div align=\"left\">\n            <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n              <tr>\n                <td width=\"100%\" valign=\"top\"><p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
