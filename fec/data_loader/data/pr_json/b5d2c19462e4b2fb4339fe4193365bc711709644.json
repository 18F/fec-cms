A federal court in Florida has previously ordered the Reform Party to repay to the Treasury more than $300,000 of the public funds the Reform Party received for its 2000 convention, which the Commission found to have been used for impermissible expenditures.

The Commission found reason to believe that the Reform Party 2000 Convention Committee, the Reform Party of the United States of America, and the treasurers of both committees, violated the law by making an improper payment of public funds to The Performance Group for convention expenses.&#160; The Commission then determined to hold these matters in abeyance pending the conclusion of other repayment proceedings.&#160; However, no further action was taken because the FEC has already obtained a judgment in federal court against the Reform Party for repayment of $333,558 in public funds used for its Convention. </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering \n\n\n5164 and/or 5182 \n\n under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p>&#160;</p>\n          </td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>3.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5538&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5544</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Missourians for Hanaway, Susan Ely, treasurer</p>\n          (b)&#160;&#160; Bush-Cheney &#8217;04, Inc., Salvatore Purpura, treasurer</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p> Corey Dillon, Executive Director, Missouri Democrat Party  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p> Excessive contribution; corporate contribution </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>DISPOSITION:</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a-b)&#160;&#160;&#160; No reason to believe<strong>*</strong></p>\n            <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; [re: excessive contribution; corporate contribution]</p>\n            <p/>\n          The complainant alleged that Missourians for Hanaway, Catherine Hanaway&#8217;s 2004 campaign committee for Missouri Secretary of State, and Bush-Cheney &#8217;04 Inc. coordinated their efforts in production and dissemination of a television advertisement that constituted an in-kind contribution to the President&#8217;s campaign and an electioneering communication. The Hanaway Committee explained that the advertisement was prepared solely by it to support Hanaway&#8217;s state campaign, there were no other federal candidates depicted in the commercial and the President&#8217;s campaign signs were not even readable in the advertisement. The Hanaway Committee further explained that there was no involvement by the President or his agents and no common vendors, former employees or independent contractors of the President&#8217;s campaign involved with the production of the advertisement. The Bush-Cheney Committee also denied that the President&#8217;s campaign had any involvement. The Commission found no reason to believe the respondents violated the law because there was no evidence of a coordinated communication; the advertisement does not promote or support the President; and it falls under the State and local candidate endorsement exemption to the electioneering communication provisions. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering  5544 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>4.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5697&amp;CASETYPE=mur\"><strong>MUR 5697</strong></a></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> Missouri Democratic State Committee, Rod Anderson, treasurer </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> FEC Initiated (Audit)  </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> Excessive contributions; excessive anonymous cash contributions; excessive contributions (in the form of untimely reimbursed staff advances); failure to keep proper records of its disbursements  </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><strong>DISPOSITION:</strong></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>Conciliation Agreement: $20,000 civil penalty<strong>*</strong></p>\n            <p> This matter was generated by the Audit Division of the FEC.
