While individuals can contribute up to $2,000 to a \n    candidate, only $250 per individual applies towards the $5,000 requirement \n    in each state. Candidates must also agree to abide by spending limits, to \n    keep certain records, and to submit those records for audit. Howard Dean, \n    John Kerry and President Bush have declined to participate in the Matching \n    Fund program.</p>\n    <p>Candidates may submit requests for funds once each month. The Commission \n    will certify an amount to be paid by the U.S. Treasury the following month. \n    Only contributions from individuals in amounts of no more than $250 are \n    matchable. The Commission expects that tax check-off deposits for February \n    should be sufficient for Treasury to make full payments of all certified \n    funds in March. Following the primary season, candidates may be entitled to \n    receive additional matching funds to assist in winding down their campaigns \n    or to retire debts.</p>\n    <p>The Commission has previously certified <b><u>$14,924,000</u></b> to each of the two \n    major political parties, for their 2004 Presidential Nominating Conventions.</p>\n    <p><b>* In addition, Dennis J.
