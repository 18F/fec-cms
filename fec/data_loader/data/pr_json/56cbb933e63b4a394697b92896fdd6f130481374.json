Semi-annual reporting is no longer an \n    option for Congressional committees.</p>\n    <p>October quarterly reports cover financial activity from July 1, 2003, \n    through September 30, 2003. The reports are due by close of business \n    Wednesday, October 15, if sent regular mail or hand-delivered. If sent \n    certified or registered mail, disclosure reports must be postmarked no later \n    than midnight of the due date. Electronically filed reports must be received \n    by midnight, eastern time, on the filing date. Senate campaigns file their \n    reports with the Secretary of the Senate, who then forwards the reports to \n    the FEC. All other committees file their reports with the FEC.</p>\n    <p>Digital images of campaign finance reports are now available on the FEC \n    Website, www.fec.gov. All reports filed by PACs, political parties, \n    Presidential, Senate and House campaigns are available for viewing on the \n    Web within 48 hours of the reports being received by the FEC. </p>\n    <p/>\n    <p>The Public Records Office accepts most major credit cards as method of \n    payment for copying documents and deposits for Public Records accounts. The \n    telephone number for the Public Records Office is (202) 694-1120, or \n    toll-free (800) 424-9530 (option #3). The FAXline number is (202) 501-3413.</p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" colspan=\"3\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "20031010hours.html", "date": "10/10/2003", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Announces Weekend and Extended Hours", "category": "Other Agency Actions"}
