Contributions that are not\npermissible &#150; individual contributions in excess of the\nstatutory dollar limits, all corporate and labor organization\ncontributions, and contributions from federal contractors &#150;\nare referred to as soft money. These funds are to be used\nexclusively for state and local campaign activity or other party\ncommittee activities that do not influence federal elections.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The notice of proposed\nrulemaking invites comment on options for regulating soft money,\nincluding whether or not new rules are necessary, whether the\nCommission has the authority to promulgate rules in this area,\nand whether the proposed rules contained in the notice are within\nthe scope of that authority.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Option one in the proposal\nwould be to make no changes to current rules. National parties\nwould continue to be prohibited from receiving and using soft\nmoney in connection with federal elections, but soft money for\nnon-federal election related purposes would be permitted.\nNon-federal accounts would be permitted for these non-federal\nelection purposes, along with the building fund accounts\nspecifically authorized by the FECA.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The second option is to\nmake revisions to the current rules, consisting of a core\nproposal and three variations on that. The core proposal would\nprohibit the receipt and use of soft money by the national party\ncommittees, and would eliminate all national party non-federal\naccounts except building fund accounts.</font></p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Variations to the core\nproposal include:</font></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <blockquote>\n        <blockquote>\n            <p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Modify the core\n            proposal to allow national party committees to raise\n            soft money for the limited purpose of making direct\n            or earmarked contributions to state and local\n            candidates.</font></p>\n            <p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Modify the core\n            proposal to ensure that hard money transferred from a\n            national to a state or local party committee is spent\n            using the rules applicable to the national party\n            committees, rather than the state or local party\n            committee&#146;s more favorable allocation ratios (a\n            mix of hard and soft money).</font></p>\n            <p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Modify the core\n            proposal to require state and local party committees\n            to finance their mixed activities entirely with hard\n            dollars.</font></p>\n            <p>&#160;</p>\n        </blockquote>\n    </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The proposed rulemaking\nstates, \"The objective of the proposed rules is to ensure\nthat soft money is not used to influence federal elections. In\norder to achieve this result, the core proposal virtually\neliminates the soft money available to the national party\ncommittees to subsidize activities that influence federal\nelections. Both the first and second options recognize the\nlimited scope of the FECA, and acknowledge that national party\ncommittees have other purposes besides the election of federal\ncandidates.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">\"The major difference\nbetween the two options is whether most national party\ncommittees&#146; federal and non-federal activities are\ninextricably intertwined, or, as the current rules suggest, can\nbe separated in a way that will ensure that soft money is not\nused to influence federal elections,\" the proposal\ncontinues.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">The notice stipulates that\nthe proposal does not represent a final decision by the\nCommission. The Commission will consider the proposal again after\na comment period and public hearing. That comment period extends\nto September 11, 1998. A public hearing is presently scheduled\nfor September 23.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">All comments should be\naddressed to Susan E. Propper, Assistant General Counsel, 999 E\nSt., NW, Washington, DC 20463. Faxed comments should be sent to\n202-219-3923, with printed copy follow-up. Electronic mail\ncomments should be sent to <i>softmoneynpr@fec.gov</i>.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Full text of the soft money\nrulemaking proposal is slated to be published in the Federal\nRegister on Monday, July 13.</font></p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\"># # #</font></p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n</body>\n"}
