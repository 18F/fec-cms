Civil penalties totaling $46,750 were assessed in two matters.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5913, the International Longshoremen&#8217;s Association AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education (ILA COPE) agreed to pay a civil penalty of $14,250 for a series of reporting violations.&#160; Amended versions of the committee&#8217;s 2004 April Quarterly, 2004 July Quarterly, 2004 12 Day Pre-Primary and 2004 October Quarterly reports disclosed additional disbursements totaling $298,689 that were omitted from the originally filed reports.</p>\n              <p>MUR 5333 centered on allegations that several individual donors made excessive contributions to John Swallow for Congress, the principal campaign committee of 2002 Congressional candidate John Swallow (UT/02).&#160; The Commission collected a total of $32,500 in civil penalties and reached conciliation agreements with five respondents.&#160; The Swallow committee agreed to pay a civil penalty of $8,000 for accepting excessive contributions and failing to disclose itemized contributions adequately in reports filed with the FEC.&#160; The Robert Browning Lichfield Family Limited Partnership and Robert B. Lichfield agreed to pay a $17,000 civil penalty for making excessive contributions and contributions in the name of another.&#160; WinterFox LLC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $4,000 for making excessive contributions; and WinterHawk Enterprises LLC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $3,500 for making excessive contributions.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5819, the Commission admonished the United States Chamber of Commerce for using corporate funds to pay for an automated telephone message that expressly advocated the election of former Congressman Ed Case to the U.S. Senate and failed to include adequate disclaimers.&#160; The telephone message was disseminated shortly before the 2006 Hawaii Democratic primary and cost $2,474.&#160; The FEC took no further action because of the relatively small amount of money involved and found no reason to believe Case for Senate violated the Act because the complaint did not contain any information suggesting the automated telephone calls were coordinated.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5732, the Commission found no reason to believe Matt Brown for U.S. Senate, the Democratic Party of Hawaii, the Maine Democratic State Committee, or the Massachusetts Democratic State Committee &#8211; Federal violated the Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act).&#160; The matter stemmed from allegations that Matt Brown for U.S. Senate, the principal campaign committee of 2006 Senate candidate Matthew Brown (RI), arranged for its donors to contribute to the aforementioned state political party committees as part of an effort to circumvent the Act&#8217;s contribution limits.&#160; The complaint alleged contributions made the by Brown committee&#8217;s donors to the state parties were used to support the Brown campaign.&#160; The Commission concluded there was no evidence that donors earmarked or designated contributions to the state parties to be used to support the Brown committee. </p>\n              <p>In MUR 5845, the Commission found no reason to believe Citizens for Truth (CFT) or Friends of Mike Sodrel, the campaign committee of former U.S. Representative Mike Sodrel (IN/09), violated the Act by sharing donors and coordinating the production of billboard advertisements and other public communications.&#160; The Commission concluded the complaint lacked sufficient facts to warrant an investigation.&#160; </p>\n              <p>In MUR 5802, the Commission found no reason to believe the City of Chicago, Congressman Rahm Emanuel (IL/05), or his principal campaign committee, Friends of Rahm Emanuel, violated the Act.&#160; The matter stemmed from allegations that the City of Chicago made prohibited in-kind contributions to Friends of Rahm Emanuel by using municipal employees to circulate nominating petitions on behalf of Congressman Emanuel in 2002, 2004 and 2006.&#160; The complaint further alleged the Emanuel committee accepted and failed to report the contributions.&#160; The Commission concluded the matter did not warrant investigation because no information was presented to support allegations that petition collectors were anything other than volunteers, collecting petitions on their own volition and time.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5855, the Commission found no reason to believe the National Education Association Fund for the Children and Public Education (NEA Fund) violated the Act&#8217;s reporting requirements.&#160; The complaint alleged the NEA made independent expenditures related to the 2006 general election and failed to disclose them to the FEC within 48 hours.&#160; The complaint was filed, however, before the report was due.&#160; The NEA Fund submitted evidence that the activity was properly disclosed to the Commission within the designated 48 hour period.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5866, the Commission found no reason to believe former Senator Conrad Burns, his campaign committee, Friends of Conrad Burns &#8211; 2006, or the Inland Northwest Space Alliance (INSA) violated the Act.&#160; The matter stemmed from allegations that Senator Burns earmarked taxpayer funds for INSA with the understanding that INSA employees would make contributions to his campaign committee.&#160; The complaint alleged the activity violated the prohibition against corporate contributions and contributions in the name of another.&#160; The Commission determined there was insufficient information to initiate an investigation.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5867, the Commission found no reason to believe the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) violated the Act by using corporate funds for activity related to the election of a federal candidate.&#160; The complaint alleged a September 2005 colorectal cancer dinner program sponsored by ACG served as a fundraiser for Senator Rick Santorum&#8217;s (PA) bid for re-election and that several billboards thanking Santorum and other officeholders for their support provided political support to their re-election campaigns.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5834, the Commission dismissed allegations against 2006 Congressional candidate Darcy Burner (WA/08) and her principal campaign committee, Darcy Burner for Congress, concerning inadequate FEC disclaimers on television ads and found no reason to believe the Burner committee accepted corporate contributions.&#160; The complaint alleged television ads produced by the committee did not comply with the &#8220;stand by your ad&#8221; requirements and therefore did not qualify for the discounted &#8220;lowest unit charge&#8221; rate available for certain political ads under Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations.&#160; As a result, the complainant alleged the Burner committee received corporate contributions from stations that aired the ads.&#160; Respondents admitted the initial inadvertent omission and contended it was remedied immediately upon discovery.&#160; The Burner committee further contended the ad did not make reference to any other candidates for the same office and therefore the FCC&#8217;s &#8220;stand by your ad&#8221; requirement that entitles a committee to the &#8220;lowest unit charge&#8221; did not apply.&#160; The FEC concluded the allegations were unsupported and the Commission lacked jurisdiction to make determinations regarding FCC disclaimer requirements.</p>\n              <p>Under the law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases or Matters Under Review (MURs) through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group the Commission determines has violated the law.&#160;

Reason to believe (re: excessive contributions); Take no further action (re: excessive contributions)</p>\n                      <p>The complaint alleged 46 individuals made excessive contributions to John Swallow for Congress, the principal campaign committee of 2002 Congressional candidate John Swallow (UT/02).&#160; The complaint further alleged ten of the named contributors were children whose contributions were made to circumvent individual contributions.</p>\n                      <p>In the 2002 cycle, an individual could contribute up to $1,000 per election to a candidate.&#160; Mr. Swallow participated in the primary and general elections as well as a party convention held prior to the primary.&#160; The complaint failed to take into account that an individual could have contributed up to $3,000 to Mr. Swallow&#8217;s committee in 2002.&#160; As a result, the Commission found no reason to believe 26 contributors violated the Act by making excessive contributions.</p>\n                      <p>The Commission found reason to believe a number of respondents violated the Act and reached conciliation agreements with five of them.&#160; </p>\n                      <p>Robert B. Lichfield, the general partner of the Robert Browning Lichfield Family Limited Partnership, used partnership funds to write ten checks in the amount of $3,000 each to the Swallow committee.&#160; On the bottom of each check, he wrote the name of the individual to whom each contribution was attributed and obtained the approval of each member before the checks were deposited.&#160; The partnership contributions aggregated $30,000, exceeding the partnership limit of $1,000 per candidate per election.&#160; Additionally, partnership funds were used to make contributions from individuals who were not members of the partnership, constituting contributions in the name of another.&#160; The Lichfield Partnership and Robert B. Lichfield agreed to pay a civil penalty of $17,000 for violating the Act.</p>\n                      <p>The FEC&#8217;s investigation also revealed that contributions made by eleven respondents were made via checks drawn on accounts of limited liability companies.&#160; Because these companies elect to be treated as partnerships by the Internal Revenue Service, their contributions are treated as contributions from the companies as well as from the eleven partners.&#160; The Commission found reason to believe WinterFox LLC and WinterHawk Enterprises LLC each made excessive contributions to the Swallow committee.&#160; WinterFox agreed to pay a civil penalty of $4,000 for making excessive contributions totaling $10,000.&#160; WinterHawk agreed to pay a civil penalty of $3,500 for making excessive contributions totaling $9,000.</p>\n                      <p>The Commission found reason to believe the Swallow committee violated the Act by accepting excessive contributions and failing to disclose itemized contributions adequately on FEC reports.&#160; The committee accepted contributions from three partnerships, WinterHawk Enterprises LLC, Winterfox LLC and BMF #1, Ltd., that were attributed to individual members of each partnership.&#160; The committee reported the contributions as contributions from the individuals to whom they were attributed, but failed to disclose the contributions from the partnerships.&#160; Additionally, the contributions from WinterHawk and WinterFox were excessive.&#160; The committee agreed to pay a civil penalty of $8,000, amend its reports and cease and desist from committing future similar violations.</p></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n                      <p><strong/></p>\n                      <p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5333 under case numbers in the Enforcement Query System.
