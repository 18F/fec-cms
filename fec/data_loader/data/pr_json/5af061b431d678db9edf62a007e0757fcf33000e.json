This represents a 22% decline in fundraising and a 35%\n    decline in spending from the 2000 cycle. </p>\n    <p>Comparisons across election cycles are particularly difficult for Senate races however,\n    because there are more small population states with Senate elections in 2002, and because\n    a few campaigns can significantly affect totals. For example, through June of 2000 there\n    were three Senate campaigns (Corzine, ($35.7 million), Giuliani, ($23.3 million), and\n    Clinton ($18.6 million)) with receipts more than twice the largest 2002 campaign (Dole,\n    $8.2 million). </p>\n    <p>Recent Senate elections have included a fundraising technique designed to help provide\n    funds to candidates and also to national and state parties. Joint fundraising committees\n    are often created to focus on Senate campaigns and raise both hard money for candidates\n    and parties along with soft money for national and state parties. Hard money from joint\n    fundraising transferred to Senate candidates has totaled $3.8 million to Republicans and\n    $2.6 million to Democrats thus far in 2002. Soft money transferred from joint committees\n    to national party committees totaled $6.5 million to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign\n    Committee and $1.2 million to the National Republican Senatorial Committee through June\n    30, 2002. The table on pages 22-26 lists joint fundraising committees, transfers, and soft\n    money transferred to national committees organized by the candidate who authorized the\n    joint fundraising committee.</p>\n    <p>Fundraising in House campaigns increased slightly during the first 18 months of the\n    2002 campaign. Current campaigns raised $402.4 million (up 2% from 2000 levels) and spent\n    $247.9 million (6% above previous cycle totals). They reported a cash balance of $263.1\n    million as of June 30. The increases are confined to incumbent and open seat candidates\n    from both parties, while challengers&#146; financial activity is behind 2000 levels.\n    Tables appearing on p. 6 confirm these changes, with median receipts for House incumbents\n    up substantially for both parties while challengers median receipts are lower than in\n    2000. Moreover, the number of House challengers who reported receipts of at least $50,000\n    through the first half of the election year dropped from 206 in 2000 to 154 in 2002, the\n    smallest number in the last six election cycles.</p>\n    <p>Contributions from individuals totaled $353.1 million and continue to be the largest\n    source of receipts for Congressional candidates, representing 58.4% of all fundraising as\n    of June 30. Contributions from PACs and other committees totaled $168.5 million or 27.9%\n    while candidates themselves contributed or loaned a total of $54.6 million that was 9% of\n    all receipts.</p>\n    <p>Tables attached to this release offer summary data for Senate and House candidates by\n    political party, as well as by candidate status (incumbent, challenger, or open seat).\n    Also included are rankings of Senate and House candidates for the following categories:\n    receipts, individual contributions, PAC and other committee contributions, disbursements,\n    cash-on-hand, and debts owed. Six-year financial summaries of Senate candidates for 2002,\n    as well as current cycle financial summaries for each House campaign are also attached.\n    Financial information on House special elections is listed separately.</p>\n    <p>This release and the data contained in it are also available on the FEC&#146;s web site\n    at http://www.fec.gov under News Releases or Campaign Finance Reports and Data.</p>\n    <p class=\"bold\">Tables</p>\n    <p>The tables in [HTML] format can be read using your web browser.
