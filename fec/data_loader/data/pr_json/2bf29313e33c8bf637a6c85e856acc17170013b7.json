CARN...DEM</b></h3>\n<p>\n</p><h3><b>PA/04...ADAMETZ CONGRESS...KATRINA M. ADAMETZ, TREAS...PAUL\nT. ADAMETZ...REP</b></h3>\n<p>\nThe report was to include financial activity occurring from April\n1 through April 29.  If sent by registered mail, the report should\nhave been postmarked by May 4. Otherwise, the due date was closeofbusiness\nMay 7.\n</p><p>\nSome individuals and their committees have no obligation to file\nreports under federal election law, even though their names may\nappear on state ballots.  If an individual raises or spends less\nthan $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\"\nsubject to reporting under the FECA.\n</p><p>\nThe FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential\nfiling requirements on April 13.  Those committees which did not\nfile on the due date were notified on May 8 that reports had not\nbeen received and that their names would be published if they\ndid not respond within four business days.\n</p><p>\nOther political committees supporting Senate and House candidates\nin elections (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's\ncampaign) also are required to file preprimary reports, unless\nthey report monthly.  Those committee names are not published\nby the FEC.\n</p><p>\nFurther Commission action against nonfilers and late filers is\ndecided on a casebycase basis.  Federal law gives the FEC broad\nauthority to initiate enforcement actions, including the imposition\nof civil penalties ($5,000 for \"any violation\" and $10,000\nfor any \"knowing and willful\" violation).\n</p><p>\nThe next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate\ncommittees will be the quarterly report due July 15.  It will\ncover activity from April 30 through June 30.\n</p><p>\n# # #\n</p></body>\n\n", "href": "nf515.htm", "date": "05/15/1998", "pdf": null, "title": "Campaigns Cited for Failure to File Pre-Primary Report", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
