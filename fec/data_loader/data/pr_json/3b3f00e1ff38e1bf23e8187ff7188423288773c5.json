The Federal Election Commission (FEC/the Commission) recently resolved 10 enforcement cases.</p>\n              <p>In Matter Under Review (MUR) 5809, the Christian Voter Project agreed to pay a $38,000 civil penalty for failing to comply with multiple reporting provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act).&#160; Amended reports filed by the committee revealed that it failed to file required 24 Hour and 48 Hour notices related to 2004 independent expenditures totaling $294,136.&#160; The committee also failed to disclose additional independent expenditures totaling $125,022 and operating expenses totaling $58,656.&#160; </p>\n              <p>In MUR 5750, Laffey US Senate, the principal campaign committee of 2006 Senate candidate Stephen Laffey (RI), agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty for failing to comply with the Act&#8217;s reporting requirements for earmarked contributions.&#160; The committee received earmarked contributions through the Club for Growth (CFG), but failed to identify CFG as a conduit on FEC disclosure reports.&#160; When a candidate committee receives earmarked contributions, it is required to report certain information regarding earmarked contributions that exceed an aggregate of $200, including the conduit&#8217;s identity, the total amount of earmarked contributions received, the date of receipt, and individual contributor information.&#160; The Laffey committee received a total of $366,378 in earmarked contributions from CFG during 2005 and 2006.&#160; </p>\n              <p>In MUR 5770, the Commission dismissed allegations that the City of Cranston, Rhode Island, and then-Mayor Stephen Laffey made, and Laffey US Senate accepted, a prohibited in-kind contribution.&#160; The complaint centered on allegations that Cranston and Mayor Laffey coordinated with Laffey&#8217;s 2006 US Senate campaign committee to produce a cover letter from Mayor Laffey that was included with Cranston property tax bills.&#160; The Commission dismissed the matter after determining it did not warrant further investigation.&#160; A Statement of Reasons from Chairman Lenhard and Commissioners von Spakovsky, Walther, and Weintraub is available at [web link].</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5823, the Commission found no reason to believe Club for Growth (CFG) or its political action committee, Club for Growth PAC (CFG PAC), violated the Act.&#160; The complaint alleged CFG and CFG PAC committed multiple violations of the Act by making communications coordinated with Federal candidates and using corporate general treasury funds to pay for portions of its political action committee (PAC) website containing endorsements of Federal candidates.&#160; Additionally, the Commission dismissed allegations that CFG failed to register with the FEC as a political committee because these violations were the subject of now resolved district court litigation.&#160; Consult the FEC website at <a href=\"20070905cfg.shtml\">http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/20070905cfg.shtml</a> for additional information.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5788, the Commission found no reason to believe the Republican Federal Committee of Pennsylvania (RFCP) or Santorum 2006 violated the Act.&#160; The complaint alleged that a mailer distributed by RFCP prior to the 2006 election was coordinated with Santorum 2006, the principal campaign committee then-Senator Rick Santorum (PA), and constituted an excessive in-kind contribution.&#160; The Commission determined that the communication did not satisfy any of the content standards used to determine if a communication is coordinated, and specifically concluded that the mailer contained no express advocacy.&#160; The Commission dismissed additional allegations that the communication failed to comply with the Act&#8217;s disclaimer requirements.</p>\n              <p>In MUR 5437, the Commission voted to take no further action and close the file in a matter involving Service Employees International Union Local 250 (SEIU) or its political action committee, SEIU Committee on Political Education (SEIU COPE).&#160; The complaint alleged SEIU improperly solicited members for contributions to SEIU COPE by using threats of discipline and made contributions from the SEIU general treasury by requiring members to work on political campaigns as part of their job duties.&#160; The complaint also alleged SEIU COPE accepted prohibited contributions from members who were foreign nationals.&#160; However, following an extensive investigation, the Commission determined that there was insufficient evidence of the alleged violations and closed the file.</p>\n              <p>MUR 5806 centered on allegations that Kagen Allergy Clinic made a prohibited in-kind contribution to Kagen 4 Congress by developing and providing web site content at no charge.&#160; Dr. Steven Kagen, owner of Kagen Allergy Clinic, ran for Congress in 2006 (WI/08).&#160; Information regarding certain health initiatives that appeared on the Clinic&#8217;s web site appeared in materially identical form on the Kagen 4 Congress website.&#160; The Commission determined that Kagen 4 Congress had paid for, and properly reported, expenses related to its website, and found no reason to believe any prohibited contribution was made to the campaign by either the clinic or Dr. Kagen.</p>\n              <p>The FEC dismissed three enforcement cases involving candidate debates.&#160; In MUR 5817, 2004 Congressional candidate Werner Lange (OH/14) alleged that Lakeland Community College excluded him from a debate because he was not nominated by a political party.&#160; In MUR 5847, Lange alleged he was excluded by the City Club of Cleveland for the same reason.&#160; In MUR 5852, 2006 Michigan Senate candidate David Sole alleged he was excluded from a debate held at the Detroit Economic Club.&#160; The Commission dismissed the allegations in all three matters after determining they did not warrant further review.</p>\n              <p>By law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases or Matters Under Review (MURs) through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group the Commission determines has violated the law.&#160;

According to RAD&#8217;s referral, the respondents failed to file necessary 48-Hour and 24-Hour reports related to independent expenditures made by the Christian Voter Project (the Committee) in 2004.&#160; Review of reports also indicated the Committee failed to disclose additional disbursements and dates of dissemination for independent expenditures.</p>\n                      <p>Under the Act, a committee that makes independent expenditures aggregating $10,000 or more at any time up to and including the 20th day before the election is required to file a report detailing the expenditures within 48 hours.&#160; The Committee&#8217;s amended 2004 April, July and October Quarterly Reports indicated that it failed to file eleven 48-Hour notices concerning 34 general election independent expenditures totaling $245,113. </p>\n                      <p>Under the Act, a committee that makes independent expenditures aggregating $1,000 or more after the 20th day, but more than 24 hours before the election is required to file a report detailing the expenditures within 24 hours.&#160; The Committee&#8217;s amended 2004 Post General Report indicated the committee failed to file five 24-Hour notices concerning 11 general election independent expenditures totaling $49,023.</p>\n                      <p>Review of the Committee&#8217;s reports indicated the Christian Vote Project also failed to disclose certain disbursements, including independent expenditures and operating expenses, on its 2004 April Quarterly and 2005 Mid-year Reports.&#160; Amended versions of the reports disclosed additional independent expenditures totaling $125,022.61 and operating expenses totaling $58,656.74.&#160; The Commission also found that the Committee omitted the dates of independent expenditures from the 2004 April and October Quarterly Reports as well as the 2005 Mid-Year Report.</p>\n                      <p>The Committee signed a conciliation agreement containing a civil penalty of $38,000.</p>\n                  </td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n                      <p><strong/></p>\n                      <p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <u><a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a></u> by entering 5809 under case numbers in the Enforcement Query System.

</p>\n                      <p>According to the complainant, the Laffey committee failed to comply with the Act&#8217;s reporting requirements by failing to disclose conduit information for contributions collected and forwarded by the Club for Growth (CFG).&#160; Commission investigation revealed the Laffey committee received $366,378 in earmarked contributions from CFG between October 1, 2005 and March 31, 2006.&#160; The committee admitted that it did not identify CFG as a conduit on its reports, but stated that it knew CFG was disclosing the contributions in its FEC reports.&#160; The committee filed amended reports about one month after receiving the complaint.</p>\n                      <p>The FEC found reason to believe Laffey US Senate violated the Act by failing to identify CFG as a conduit on disclosure reports filed with the Commission.&#160; Respondents agreed to pay a civil penalty of $25,000 and cease and desist from committing future similar violations.&#160; The Commission found no reason to believe CFG violated the Act.</p>\n                      <p>The complaint also alleged the Laffey committee failed to disclose certain disbursements for mailing and printing.&#160; The allegation was based on a news story in which Laffey&#8217;s campaign manager stated that the campaign spent $69,549 on direct mailings.&#160; Reports filed with the FEC through March 2006 showed only $20,000 in mailing-related disbursements.&#160; The Laffey committee claimed that the remaining balance was not reported because it did not receive invoices from the direct mail vendor exceeding a total $18,256 until after March 31, 2006.</p>\n                      <p>The complaint alleged ALS made a prohibited corporate contribution to the Laffey committee by distributing to all ALS employees a letter expressly advocating the election of Stephen Laffey.&#160; The complaint further alleged the letter, which was written on corporate letterhead and signed by ALS president Vincent Indeglia, was coordinated with the Laffey campaign or used to develop a voter list that was provided to the Laffey committee.&#160; Indeglia and ALS claimed the letter was by Indeglia on his own time and expressed his personal opinions and made available to the general public in the ALS lobby, but not distributed to all employees.&#160;

The complaint further alleged CFG PAC failed to report these expenses as in-kind contributions on reports filed with the FEC.&#160; Additional information provided during the Commission&#8217;s investigation showed that CFG PAC paid for and properly reported expenditures for photographs and promotional materials for endorsements on its website.</p>\n                      <p>Finally, the complaint alleged the candidate endorsements on CFG and CFG PAC&#8217;s website were coordinated with the campaigns because they feature photographs and other material prepared by the candidates and their agents.&#160; CFG PAC maintained that the endorsements were prepared in-house or using web designers.</p>\n                      <p>The Commission dismissed the allegation that CFG failed to register and report as a political committee and found no reason to believe any of the respondents violated provisions of the Act. </p>\n                  </td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p>\n                      <p><strong/></p>\n                      <p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <u><a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> </u>by entering 5739 under case numbers in the Enforcement Query System.
