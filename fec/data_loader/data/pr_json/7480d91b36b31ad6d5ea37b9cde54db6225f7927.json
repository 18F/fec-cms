This brings to 172 \n        the total number of cases released since the ADR program began October \n        2, 2000. The program's goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement \n        matters, reduce the cost of processing complaints, and enhance overall \n        FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available \n        in the FEC's Press and Public Records offices. </span></p>\n      <p align=\"left\"> <span>For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent \n        must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside \n        the statute of limitations while the case is pending in the ADR Office, \n        and agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if necessary, \n        mediation.</span></p>\n      <p align=\"left\"><span>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching \n        an expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both \n        satisfying to the respondent(s) and in compliance with the Federal Election \n        Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions reached through direct and, when necessary, \n        mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval. \n        If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds \n        by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved \n        through ADR are not precedential.</span></p>\n      <p align=\"RIGHT\"/>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\"><b>1.</b></td>\n          <td width=\"29%\"><b>ADR 202 </b></td>\n          <td width=\"65%\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"65%\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\"><b>RESPONDENTS:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"65%\"> Friends of Mark Henry (TX/02), Carol Claypool, treasurer  </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\"><b>SOURCE:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"65%\"> FEC Initiated (RAD)  </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\"><b>SUBJECT:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"65%\"> Failure to report receipts and disbursements </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\"><b>NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"65%\"><p>$4,500 civil penalty\n            Respondents acknowledge that a violation of the FECA occurred due to the inexperience of a temporary treasurer.
