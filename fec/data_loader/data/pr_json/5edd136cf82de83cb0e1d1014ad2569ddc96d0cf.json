If sent by certified or registered mail, the report should have been postmarked by\nmidnight October 15.</p>\n\n<p>Committees were notified of their filing requirements on September 21. Those committees\nwhich did not file on the due date were notified on October 20 that reports had not been\nreceived and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four\nbusiness days.</p>\n\n<p>Other political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those\nwhich are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to file\nquarterly reports, unless they report monthly. Those committees are not published by the\nFEC.</p>\n\n<p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a\ncase-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement\nactions and the FEC has implemented a new administrative fine program which will subject\ncommittees to penalties ranging from $125 to $16,000 or more.</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></font>\n</body>\n", "href": "102700nonfiler.htm", "date": "10/27/2000", "pdf": null, "title": "11 Campaigns Fail to File October Quarterly Report", "category": "Non-Filer Publications"}
