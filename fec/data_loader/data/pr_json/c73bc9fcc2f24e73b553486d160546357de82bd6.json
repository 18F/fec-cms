This total is 23% more than candidates raised through the same period in 2003. Contributions from individuals totaled $110.8 million while PACs and other committees gave $79.3 million to House candidates during this period. Both sources increased their giving by 29% when compared to the prior nonelection year. (Quarterly reporting has been required for Congressional campaign committees only since 2003 with the enactment of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002.)</p>\n      <p>Incumbents raised the majority of these funds, with 201 Democratic members raising $69.8 million and 217 Republicans reporting receipts of $95.8 million. In 2003 198 Democrats raised $59 million while 212 Republicans raised $75.5 million during the comparable period. </p>\n      <p>The 16 Democratic freshmen seeking reelection for the first time raised $7.6 million, while 23 Republicans who were elected for the first time in 2004 raised $13.1 million. </p>\n      <p>Nonincumbent candidates have reported raising $29.3 million in the first nine months of the year, up 34% from 2003. $15.5 million was raised by Democrats and $13.8 million by Republicans (these figures do not include special election activity). This represents a substantial increase for Democrats, whose nonincumbents raised only $4.9 million in the first nine months of 2003, while Republicans have raised less than the $16.7 million they reported through September of 2003.</p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p>The following tables in EXCEL format can be read using Excel from <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft</a> or Adobe Reader from <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/\">Adobe</a>.</p>\n    <p>House  Summary [<a href=\"house3rd.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"house3rd.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>House Incumbent Top 50 Receipts [<a href=\"top50increc.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"top50increc.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>House Incumbent Top 50 Contributions from Individuals [<a href=\"top50incindiv.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"top50incindiv.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>House Incumbent Top 50 Contributions from Other Committees (PACs) [<a href=\"top50incpac.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"top50incpac.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>House Incumbent Top 50 Cash on Hand [<a href=\"top50inccash.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"top50inccash.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p>House Nonincumbent Top 50 Receipts [<a href=\"top50nonincrec.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"top50nonincrec.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"center\">###</p></td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</body>\n"}
