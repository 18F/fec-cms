The draft audit reports to be considered by the Commission can be found at <a href=\"../../agenda/agenda20070531.shtml\">http://www.fec.gov/agenda/agenda20070531.shtml</a>.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>Craig for Congress requested an Advisory Opinion (AO) regarding expenditures made from the candidates&#8217; personal funds which were originally described as contributions from the candidate.&#160; The committee asks whether it may amend its original filings to reflect that these funds were actually loans from the candidate, and whether it may accept contributions to repay those loans.&#160; The AO request, along with any comments received prior to the meeting, can be found at http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=pending.&#160; The draft AO to be considered by the Commission is located at <a href=\"../../agenda/2007/mtgdoc07-38.pdf\">http://www.fec.gov/agenda/2007/mtgdoc07-38.pdf</a>.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>The FEC will also consider a draft Statement of Policy describing the requirements for meeting the Federal Election Campaign Act&#8217;s &#8220;best efforts&#8221; standard for obtaining, maintaining and submitting financial information to the Commission.&#160; The Commission will also consider a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Federal Election Activity as defined in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. The Commission is seeking comment on a proposed rule that would make permanent, with certain minor revisions, an Interim Final Rule that excluded from FEA certain voter identification and get-out-the-vote activities conducted exclusively for non-Federal elections.&#160; Both the draft Statement of Policy and the draft Notice of Proposed Rulemaking will be released prior to Thursday's meeting.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>The meeting will be held at 2 p.m. in the 9th floor hearing room at the Commission's offices at 999 E Street N.W. in Washington.</p>\n              <p>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency.
