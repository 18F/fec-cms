On January 12, the Commission discussed an advisory opinion request from Louder Solutions, LLC, a for-profit limited liability company that plans to establish a web application through the website StandLouder.com that will allow users to post and fund proposed advertisements. In its advisory opinion request, StandLouder indicates that it will receive a license from content creators to, among other services, facilitate funding, provide technical compliance, and determine the time and placement of the ads.StandLouder.com anticipates that the advertisements will relate to topics including political and social issues as well as candidates for federal office. The request posed questions regarding whether its proposed business model would trigger political committee status and also whether StandLouder.com could identify itself in disclaimers and disclosure reports as the entity that paid for the advertisements. After discussion of the request and several <a href=\"../../agenda/2012/agenda20120112.shtml\">draft responses</a>, the Commission decided to hold it over until the Commission&#8217;s next Open Session, which is scheduled for January 19, 2012. </p>\n        <p>          <u>Drafts</u></p>\n        <p><strong><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1189599.pdf\">AO 2011-25 (Atlas Air)</a>.</strong> On January 13, the Commission made public a <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1191453.pdf\">draft</a> of Advisory Opinion 2011-25.

The complaint alleged further that RSMC accepted contributions from prohibited sources and failed to include a written disclaimer on advertisements containing express advocacy, indicating whether these communications were authorized by a candidate or authorized committee. <br/>\n        DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe RSMC failed to organize, register and report as a political committee because there was no reason to believe that its major purpose was the nomination or election of a Federal candidate.
