Arkansas and Kentucky will be holding primary elections on May \n18, 2004, to select candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>Provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act require committees supporting \ncandidates involved in the primary to file reports of their financial activity \n12 days before the election.</p>\n<p>As of 5 p.m., May 13, 2004, disclosure reports from the following committees \nhad not been filed:</p>\n<p><b>AR??JIM HOLT FOR U. S. SENATE?JUNE A. HUFFEY, TREAS?JIM HOLT?REP</b></p>\n\n<p><b>KY/06?KANNENSOHN FOR CONGRESS?ROBERT P. TRINLER, TREAS</b></p>\n<p>?MARGARET H. KANNENSOHN?DEM</p>\n<dir>\n  <p>* KY/06?BRYAN S. COFFMAN CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE?CORRIE WILLIAMS, \n  TREAS?BRYAN S. COFFMAN?REP</p>\n</dir>\n\n<p>The reports were to include financial activity occurring from April 1, 2004 \nthrough April 28, 2004. If sent by certified, registered or overnight mail, the \nreports should have been postmarked by May 3. Otherwise, the due date was \nclose&#8209;of&#8209;business May 6. Mandatory electronic filing requirements became \neffective as of January 1, 2001. Any committee that receives contributions or \nmakes expenditures in excess of $50,000 in the current calendar year, or that \nreasonably expects to do so, must submit its reports electronically. These rules \nbecame effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2001.</p>\n<p>Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports \nunder federal election law, even though their names may appear on state ballots. \nIf an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered \na \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n<p/>\n<p align=\"CENTER\">-more-</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential filing \nrequirements on April 12. Those committees which did not file on the due date \nwere notified on May 7 that reports had not been received and that their names \nwould be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n<p>Other political committees supporting House candidates in elections (those \nwhich are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to \nfile pre&#8209;primary reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names are \nnot published by the FEC.</p>\n<p>Further Commission action against non&#8209;filers and late filers falls under the \nAdministrative Fine Program. Political committees and treasurers who fail to \nfile their reports on time may be subject to civil money penalties ranging from \n$30 to $16,000 (or more for repeat late- and non-filers).</p>\n<p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees will \nbe the quarterly report, due July 15. It will cover activity from April 29 \nthrough June 30.</p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p>\n<b>\n</b><p>* The Bryan S.
