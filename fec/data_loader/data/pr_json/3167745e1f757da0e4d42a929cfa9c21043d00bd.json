Few government managers\nexperience the pleasure of working with a staff which is so\nuniformly bright, motivated and well-focused as it is at the\nFederal Election Commission.\"</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">At the Department of\nAgriculture, Surina will be director of a new office charged with\nassuring that the staff in all component agencies is trained in\nthe standards of conduct, that all personal financial disclosure\nreports are filed and reviewed on a timely basis, and that any\nneeded policies tailored for specific mission areas are developed\nand promulgated. </font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">\"The principal\nattraction of the job at Agriculture,\" Surina said, \"is\nthe new and exciting professional challenge I will face. We aim\nto create the means of reaching some 95,000 employees, dispersed\nin dozens of component agencies and stationed all over the world,\nwith information about the ethics rules and their individual\nreporting obligations under the law. </font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">\"I am pleased to keep\nmy career within the governmental ethics realm,\" Surina\nsaid, \"and many of the functional and technical approaches\nwe use in regulating campaign finance transfer nicely to a large\nagency ethics program.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">\"I want to thank the\nFEC Commissioners for giving me the latitude of management action\nthat I have been afforded,\" Surina noted, adding,\n\"Whomever takes my place here at the FEC will soon discover\na truly unique operating environment, a controversial but\nengaging mission, and an extraordinarily competent and\nnon-partisan staff. The staff at the FEC made me look good for 15\nyears.\"</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">Surina will remain with the\nFEC through Friday, July 31, reporting to the Department of\nAgriculture on Monday, August 3.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\"/>&#160;</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\"># # #</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\"/>&#160;</p>\n</body>\n", "href": "surina.htm", "date": "07/15/1998", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Announces Departure of Staff Director John Surina", "category": "Commission Appointments"}
