It features easily navigable maps, as well as a variety of search tools that will help users make the best use of the Commission&#8217;s data sources. Users can download many of the data sets available through the Disclosure Portal to perform their own analyses. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>&#8220;The new portal will help the Commission fulfill its mission of disclosure more efficiently and in a more user-friendly fashion,&#8221; said Chair Caroline C. Hunter. &#8220;I would like to thank the members of the Office of Chief Information Officer, as well as the staff of other divisions involved in disclosure, who worked hard to develop the disclosure portal in a way that most closely fits the needs of all those who depend on the Commission&#8217;s website for timely and accurate information.&#8221;</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>The portal, which can be accessed <a href=\"../../pindex.shtml\">here</a>, features new map-based presentations on independent expenditures and graphic presentations on national parties and political action committees (PACs). It also offers quick access to data on the most frequently-requested categories of committees that file reports with the Commission. The disclosure portal will be updated with new enhancements throughout the election cycle. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p/>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. </em></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p align=\"center\">Follow Us on Twitter - <a href=\"http://twitter.com/fec\">http://twitter.com/fec</a></p>\n        <p align=\"center\"><br/>\n  # # # </p></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n"}
