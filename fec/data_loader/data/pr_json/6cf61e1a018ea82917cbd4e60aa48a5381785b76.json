The advisory opinion concluded that the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative (VPGC), as a membership organization with incorporated and unincorporated members, may establish an SSF, solicit contributions to the SSF from its unincorporated members and deduct those contributions from settlement payments VPGC owes to these members.
