Both parties also showed an increase in non-federal,\nor \"soft money\" activity, when compared to the same\nperiod in the 1995-96 cycle, and both parties reported substantial\ndebt.  \n</p><p>\nRepublican party committees raised in excess of $59 million for\nfederal elections and spent $51.6 million from their federal (\"hard\nmoney\") accounts for the first six months of 1997, compared\nto the Democrats' $35.1 million in receipts and $33.3 million\nin expenditures.  This is a 17% decrease in receipts for Republicans\nwhen compared to the same period of 1995-96,  while the Democrats\nregistered a 25% increase in receipts over that period.  When\ncompared to the same period in 1993-94, the last non-presidential\ncycle, Republicans registered an 18% increase in receipts, while\nthe Democrats showed a 29% increase in receipts.\n</p><p>\nContributions from individuals comprised the majority of receipts\nfor both parties.  Republicans reported $51.2 million from individuals\nand  $2.7 million from PACs.  Democrats reported $23.3 million\nfrom individuals and $4.6 million from PACs.  While Democrats\nfinished the 6-month period with $5.6 million cash on hand,  they\nlisted $22.6 million in debts.  Republican totals were $11.4 million\ncash on hand and $10.7 million in debts.\n</p><p>\nRepublicans raised  $21.7 million in soft money for the first\nsix months of this year, while Democrats took in $13.7 million.\n For the same reporting period in 1995, Republicans tallied $16.6\nmillion, while Democrats raised $10.8 million.  Soft money is\nraised outside the limitations and prohibitions of the Federal\nElection Campaign Act, and must be deposited in separate non-federal\naccounts, not to be used in connection with federal elections.\n</p><p>\nCharts attached to this release provide summary data for the financial\nactivities of the two major parties during the first six months\nfor the 1997-98 election cycle and comparisons for the same period\nin the previous five cycles.  Comparable data on non-federal party\nactivity are available for only the previous three cycles.  The\nFEC began requiring national party committees to disclose their\nnon-federal accounts in January 1991.</p><p>\n\n<a href=\"/press/totfed6.htm\">Federal Summary</a></p><p>\n<a href=\"/press/repfed6.htm\">Republican Party Federal Activity</a></p><p>\n<a href=\"/press/demfed6.htm\">Democratic Party Federal Activity</a></p><p>\n<a href=\"/press/repsof6.htm\">Republican National Party Non Federal Activity</a></p><p>\n<a href=\"/press/demsof6.htm\">Democratic National Party Non Federal Activity</a></p><p>\n<a href=\"/press/longsof6.htm\">Non Federal Activity for the first Six Months of the Election Cycle 1992-1998</a>\n</p></body>\n\n", "href": "pty698.htm", "date": "09/22/1997", "pdf": null, "title": "Financial Disclosure Reports of Major Political Parties Show Increases in Soft Money Contributions", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries"}
