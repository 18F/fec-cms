The Commission has not yet determined whether \n  it will ask the court of appeals to review all, or only some, of the rules remanded \n  to the Commission by the district court.</p>\n<p>The case, <em>Shays-Meehan v. FEC </em>, which was originally filed in October \n  2002 by Representatives Christopher Shays and Martin Meehan, challenged some \n  of the Commission regulations implementing the provisions of BCRA. For more \n  information regarding the case see the <a href=\"../../pdf/record/2002/dec02.pdf#page=13\">FEC \n  <em>Record </em> of December 2002 (Vol. 28, No. 12)</a>.</p>\n<p>Following the vote to file the Notice of Appeal, FEC Chairman Bradley Smith \n  said: &#147;We believe that the Commission has a very strong case for appeal based \n  on the factual circumstances as well as legal precedent.&#148;</p>\n<p> Documents related to this case can be found on the Commission's Web Site under \n  <a href=\"../../pages/bcra/litigation.shtml#shaysmeehan\">BCRA Litigation</a>. \n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160; </p>\n</body>\n"}
