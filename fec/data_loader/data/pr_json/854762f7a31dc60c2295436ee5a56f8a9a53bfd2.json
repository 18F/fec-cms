A total of 4,328 PACs reported receipts of $397 million between January 1,\n    2001 and March 31, 2002, up 13.7% from the same period in 2000, and disbursements of\n    $315.9 million, up 12% from the previous cycle. <p>These committees contributed $131.4\n    million to federal candidates during this period, a 5.6% increase over 2000 levels. They\n    reported $230.9 million cash-on-hand as of March 31, 2002, with debts totaling $8.5\n    million.</p>\n    <p>Contributions to candidates were almost evenly divided among the major parties, with\n    Republican candidates receiving $66.4 million compared with $64.8 million contributed to\n    Democrats. Incumbents received the bulk of PAC contributions through March, with a total\n    of $115.1 million representing 87.6% of all PAC contributions. Challengers received $6.5\n    million (4.9%) and open seat candidates received $9.8 million (7.4%).</p>\n    <p>PACs sponsored by corporations represented the largest group of committees, in both\n    number of PACs and total receipts, followed by labor, nonconnected (usually ideological)\n    committees, and the group of trade associations, membership organizations, and\n    health-related PACs. The distribution of PACs by size continues to be highly skewed,\n    however, with a large number of very small committees (in terms of financial activity) and\n    a much smaller number of very large committees. The table on page 6 shows that only 1.6%\n    of all PACs (those with receipts of greater than $1 million) actually raised 39.3% of all\n    PAC funds during the first 15 months of the cycle.</p>\n    <p>The table below shows receipts, disbursements, contributions, cash-on-hand, and debts\n    for the six categories of PACs tracked by the FEC from January 1, 2001 through March 31,\n    2002.</p>\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"3\">\n      <tr>\n        <td/>\n        <th scope=\"col\" class=\"reduced\">No. of Committees</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\" class=\"reduced\">Receipts</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\" class=\"reduced\">Disbursements</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\" class=\"reduced\">Cash on Hand</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\" class=\"reduced\">Contributions</th>\n        <th scope=\"col\" class=\"reduced\">Debts Owed by</th>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td scope=\"row\"/>\n        <td scope=\"row\"/>\n        <td/>\n        <td/>\n        <td/>\n        <td/>\n        <td/>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td class=\"bold\">Corporate</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">1,672</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$112,122,173 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$89,997,142 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$67,275,180 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$49,995,587 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$198,696 </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td scope=\"row\" class=\"bold\">Labor</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">326</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$97,542,029 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$75,698,563 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$64,739,058 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$25,908,091 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$124,666 </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td scope=\"row\" class=\"bold\">Non Connected</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">1,257</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$93,178,625 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$77,188,842 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$34,862,114 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$16,658,827 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$7,742,516 </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td scope=\"row\" class=\"bold\">Trade/Membership/Health</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">914</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$85,728,144 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$65,934,266 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$56,778,585 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$35,248,980 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$67,846 </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td scope=\"row\" class=\"bold\">Cooperative</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">41</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$2,512,058 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$1,974,017 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$2,689,735 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$1,301,054 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$0 </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td scope=\"row\" class=\"bold\">Corporations Without Stock</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">118</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$5,913,041 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$5,156,687 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$4,608,857 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$2,250,934 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$374,685 </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td scope=\"row\" class=\"bold\">Total</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">4,328</td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$396,996,070 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$315,949,517 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$230,953,529 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$131,363,473 </td>\n        <td align=\"right\">$8,508,409 </td>\n      </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p>In addition to federal receipts and disbursements shown above, some PACs (mostly\n    nonconnected committees) maintain nonfederal accounts and must therefore use a combination\n    of federal and nonfederal funds to pay for activities that may relate to both federal and\n    state or local elections (overhead expenses, etc.).
