This NPRM primarily addresses communications that are made\n    independently from, or in coordination with, a candidate, an authorized committee of a\n    candidate, or a political party committee. The proposed regulations would set forth the\n    meaning of \"coordination.\" They would also set forth statutory requirements for\n    political party committees with respect to the permitted timing of independent and\n    coordinated expenditures, and transfers and assignments. Also, new rules are proposed for\n    reporting of independent expenditures.</p>\n    <p>The FEC issued the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on September 12, with a public-comment\n    and request-to-testify deadline of October 11. The Commission received 20 sets of comments\n    from various members of the public, groups, and party entities.
