FEC</em>, Civ. No. 11-0766 (D.D.C. Mar. 30, 2012), found that the Commission regulation at 11 CFR 104.20(c)(9) is invalid.&#160; That regulation, which was adopted in 2007 and governed electioneering communications by corporations and labor organizations, required that their donors be disclosed only if their donations were &#8220;made for the purpose of furthering electioneering communications.&#8221;&#160; The district court found that this limitation on disclosure contravened Congress&#8217;s intent and noted that the Commission&#8217;s pre-2007 regulation &#8220;did not add an intent requirement.&#8221;&#160; <em>Van Hollen</em>, No. 11-0766, slip. op. at 25 n.8 (D.D.C. Mar. 30, 2012).&#160; On April 27, 2012, the district court vacated the regulation at 11 CFR 104.20(c)(9) and reinstated the Commission&#8217;s prior regulation at 104.20(c), which was promulgated on December 17, 2002 and was in effect until December 25, 2007.&#160; <em>Van Hollen</em>, Civ.
