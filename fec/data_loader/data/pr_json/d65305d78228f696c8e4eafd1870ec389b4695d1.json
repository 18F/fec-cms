Under the &#8220;Millionaires&#8217; Amendment,&#8221; when a candidate&#8217;s personal expenditures exceeded certain thresholds, that candidate&#8217;s opponent(s) became eligible to receive contributions from individuals at an increased limit and could benefit from increased coordinated party expenditures. On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Davis v. FEC those provisions, along with some additional reporting requirements, were unconstitutional. </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>As a result of the Supreme Court decision, the following MURs related to reporting requirements under the &#8220;Millionaires&#8217; Amendment&#8221; have been closed and the related complaints dismissed:</p>\n              <p/>\n              <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 5726 </a>- Jack Davis for Congress (NY/26);</li>\n                <li><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 5785</a> - James E.
