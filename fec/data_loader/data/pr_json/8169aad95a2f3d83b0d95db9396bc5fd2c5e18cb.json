Nevada will be holding primary elections on September 7, 2004 \n  , to select candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;Provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act require committees \n  supporting candidates involved in the primary to file reports of their financial \n  activity 12 days before the election.</p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;As of 5 p.m. , September 2, 2004 , disclosure reports from the \n  following committees had not been filed:</p>\n<p><strong>NV/02?...&#160; &#160;&#160;JEROME BENNETT FOR CONGRESS?MARIE A. BENNETT, \n  TREAS?</strong><strong>&#160;D. JEROME BENNETT?DEM </strong></p>\n<p><strong>NV.......... &#160;&#160;FRIENDS OF TILLEY FOR U. S. SENATE?JOHN C. \n  NORTON, TREAS?</strong><strong>CHERIE M. TILLEY?REP</strong><strong>&#160; </strong></p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;The reports were to include financial activity occurring from July \n  1, 2004 through August 18, 2004 . If sent by certified, registered or overnight \n  mail, the reports should have been postmarked by August 23. Otherwise, the due \n  date was close-of-business August 26. Mandatory electronic filing requirements \n  became effective as of January 1, 2001 . Any committee that receives contributions \n  or makes expenditures in excess of $50,000 in the current calendar year, or \n  that reasonably expects to do so, must submit its reports electronically. These \n  rules became effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, \n  2001 .</p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;Some individuals and their committees have no obligation to file \n  reports under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state \n  ballots. If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not \n  considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential \n  filing requirements on August 2. Those committees which did not file on the \n  due date were notified on August 27 that reports had not been received and that \n  their names would be published if they did not respond within four business \n  days.</p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;Other political committees supporting House candidates in elections \n  (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required \n  to file pre-primary reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names \n  are not published by the FEC.</p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers falls \n  under the Administrative Fine Program. Political committees and treasurers who \n  fail to file their reports on time may be subject to civil money penalties ranging \n  from $30 to $16,000 (or more for repeat late- and non-filers).</p>\n<p>&#160;&#160;The next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees \n  will be the quarterly report, due October 15. It will cover activity from August \n  19 through September 30. </p>\n<p>&#160; </p>\n<p align=\"center\"># # # </p>\n<p>&#160; </p>\n</body>\n", "date": "09/03/2004", "href": "press2004/20040903nf.html", "category": "Non-Filer Publications", "title": "Campaigns Cited for Failure to File Pre-Primary Report", "pdf": null}
