FEC</em> in which the court remanded these regulations to the Commission for further action consistent with its opinion.</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p align=\"center\"># # #</p>\n      <p/>\n    <p/></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\" colspan=\"3\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n"}
