FEC</em></a> (Case No. 14-5199). The Court of Appeals held that Crossroads GPS has standing to defend the Commission's decision dismissing Public Citizen's administrative complaint against it and that it has a right to intervene in the case, reversing the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that the Federal Election Commission adequately represents the interests of Crossroads GPS.<br/>\n  <br/>\n  <em><br/>\n  The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. </em></p>\n        <p align=\"center\"><em><br/>\n  ###<br/>\n        </em></p>\n        <p align=\"center\"><strong> </strong></p>\n        <div align=\"center\"/></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>      \n      </div>\n      ", "date": "06/05/2015", "href": "press2015/news_releases/20150605release.shtml", "category": "Public Citizen, et al. v.
