In MUR 5689, the Commission found reason to believe that IBEW Local 429 violated the law by failing to timely transmit contributions as a collecting agent to their parent organization, but took no further action and sent an admonishment letter. And the Commission used its prosecutorial discretion to dismiss MUR 5713 relating to the Ancient Order of the Hibernians and Francis V. Foley.

Local 429 acknowledged the inaccurate name of the SSF on complainant&#8217;s payroll deduction authorization cards. The Commission found no reason to believe that IBEW Local 429 or the IBEW Local 429 Fund violated the law by failing to register and report, because IBEW Local 429 appeared to be a permissible collecting agent and there is no information to suggest that the Fund was used for any other purpose.&#160; The complainant also alleged that there was a disparity between the contributions received by Local 429 and the transfers made to the IBEW COPE Fund from 2000 through 2002. Information from 2000, 2001 and 2002 suggest that Local 429 did not timely transfer contributions pursuant to the Commission&#8217;s regulations. Given statute of limitations considerations, and in view of the fact that IBEW Local 429 has shown significant improvement in compliance transmitting contributions, the Commission found reason to believe that IBEW Local 429 and IBEW Local Fund violated the law by failing to timely transfer contributions, but took no further action and sent an admonishment letter. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p/>\n              <p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../../\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering \n\n\n5689 \n\n under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FEC&#8217;s Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>      \n      <p align=\"center\" class=\"style1\"><u>DISMISSED -Low Rated</u> </p>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>3.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5713&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5713</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"31\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"99\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"396\" valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) Division 16</p>\n            (b)&#160;&#160; Francis (Bud) V.
