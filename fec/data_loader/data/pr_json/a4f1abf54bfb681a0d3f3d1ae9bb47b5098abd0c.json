The Commission found there was no reason to believe that \n              Harold Schneider violated the Act in connection with the allegations \n              that he reimbursed family members for their contributions or that \n              the Committee violated the Act in connection with the purchase of \n              the television set. To the extent that the Committee had not reported \n              debts accurately, including the one remaining disputed reimbursement \n              claimed by Shelton , the Committee corrected the errors following \n              the interim audit report and the Commission decided to take no action \n              with respect to this allegation. The Commission found reason to \n              believe that the Committee violated the Act because if failed to \n              produce evidence of other checks or written instruments to show \n              how these contributions were designated, redesignated or reattributed \n              but decided to take no further action given the relatively small \n              amount potentially in violation and that the contributions would \n              have been allowable under the post-BCRA redesignation and reattribution \n              regulations.</p>\n            <p>The complaint in MUR 5354 alleged that the Committee failed to \n              properly report unitemized contrtibutions it had received in both \n              its 2002 12 Day Pre-General and October Quarterly Reports. The Committee \n              corrected the errors of which Mr. Merritt complained and the Commission \n              decided to take no action with respect to these allegations.</p>\n            <p>The complaint in MUR 5361 alleged that Michael Shelton was responsible \n              for running four political communications that bore false disclaimers \n              stating that Schneider and the Committee had authorized them when \n              in fact they had not. </p>\n            The Commission found no reason to believe that Mr. Shelton had violated \n            the law with regard to the disclaimers because it appeared that he \n            was an agent of the Committee for the purpose of authorizing the communications \n            and had the candidate's permission to authorize distribution of them \n            without explicit advance approval, and either the Committee or Mr. \n            Shelton apparently paid for the communications in full or in part. \n            The Commission found reason to believe that the committee violated \n            the law because the disclaimers on two of the four political communications \n            were technically defective because they did not state that the Committee \n            paid for the communications. The Commission found reason to believe \n            that Mr. Shelton and Ms. Harwell violated the Act by making excessive \n            contributions in the form of advances and the Committee violated the \n            Act by receiving these excessive contributions and by failing to amend \n            its Statement of Organization in a timely manner. The Commission decided \n            to take no further action against these respondents. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\">Documents from these matters are available from the \n            Commission's web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering \n            5350/5354 and 5361under case number.
