On June 12, the Commission discussed <a href=\"../../../agenda/2014/agenda20140612.shtml\">two draft Advisory Opinions and a draft closeout letter</a> in response to a request from Enterprise Holdings, Inc., and held over further discussion and a vote until the next open meeting on June 26. The requestor asked whether the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) and Commission regulations preempted New York state law regarding the requestor&#8217;s use of payroll deductions to process voluntary contributions to its separate segregated fund, insofar as the New York state law applies to such deductions. During the discussion, the Commission heard from counsel on behalf of the requestor.</p>\n          <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n          <p>The Commission made public one closed case, as follows. For more information, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.</p>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6642</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: Minnesota Democratic Farmer Labor Party<br/>\n          RESPONDENT: Christopher Kauffman <br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that an unknown person or persons paid for and displayed a billboard advertisement referring to United States Senator Amy Klobuchar without the required disclaimer identifying who paid for the ad. The complaint also alleged that the unknown persons responsible for the ad may have triggered political committee status and may have been required to file disclosure reports with the Commission.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission found reason to believe that unknown respondents failed to identify the person or persons who paid for the advertisement at issue. The Commission authorized an investigation that revealed that Kauffman had paid $3,000 for production and display of the billboard ad, and determined that Kauffman failed to include a proper disclaimer in the ad and failed to file an independent expenditure report. Based on the totality of the circumstances, however, the Commission took no further action in light of the small amount at issue and because the matter appears to have stemmed from an isolated act by an individual inexperienced in making independent expenditures and acting in his individual capacity. The Commission also found no reason to believe that Kauffman failed to register and report as a political committee. The Commission sent a letter of caution, reminding Kauffman of the Commission&#8217;s requirements concerning disclaimers and the reporting of independent expenditures.</p>\n          <p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FINES</strong><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </strong></p>\n          <p>The Commission made public one campaign finance enforcement matter that was resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program, as follows.
