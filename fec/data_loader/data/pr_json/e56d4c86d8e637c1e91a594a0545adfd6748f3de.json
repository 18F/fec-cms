Stephen Barger, Donald Mitchell, and Thomas Schulz. The conciliation \n      agreement resulted in a civil penalty of $297,000. \n      <p>This agreement completed an investigation into allegations that the KSDCC, \n        a labor organization representing carpenters and other crafts persons \n        within the State of Kentucky , Mr. Barger, Mr. Mitchell, and Mr. Schulz \n        coerced union employees into making political contributions to federal \n        candidates and working in candidates' campaign offices under threat of \n        job loss and/or other consequences. The union also illegally bundled contributions \n        from union members and failed to disclose communications to members that \n        expressly advocated the election or defeat of federal candidates.</p>\n      <p>The FEC investigation found that, during at least the 1998, 2000, and \n        2002 election cycles, the union assigned employees known as \"field \n        representatives\" to work directly for the campaigns of federal, state, \n        and local candidates on union time. Based upon weekly salaries and the \n        total hours worked, KSDCC provided as much as $141,000 in salaries for \n        union staff working with the unions' endorsed candidates during the ten \n        weeks preceding the general elections. Many of the hours spent on campaign \n        activity were in connection with federal campaigns and included attendance \n        at rallies and campaign meetings, participation in precinct walks and \n        literature drops, the posting of campaign signs, recruitment of volunteers, \n        and communications with KSDCC's members. KSDCC also hired additional staff \n        before the 2000 General Election for the purpose of assisting the union's \n        endorsed federal and nonfederal candidates.</p>\n      <p>Labor organizations may not require employees to work with federal candidates \n        on activities directed to the general public as part of their job responsibilities \n        or compensate employees for the time they spend engaging in such activities. \n        Otherwise, the monetary value of the time spent working with federal candidates \n        on activities directed to the general public constitutes an in-kind contribution \n        from the labor organization to the federal candidate in violation the \n        FECA and FEC regulations.</p>\n      <p>In addition, during at least the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, KSDCC \n        solicited and monitored contributions from its employees to federal candidates. \n        The union told employees which candidates to support, and how much to \n        contribute, and it gave a deadline by which contributions needed to be \n        sent to the union office. These contributions were then collected, bundled, \n        and forwarded by the union to the federal candidate committees.</p>\n      <p>The evidence also showed that making contributions to federal candidates \n        was a required part of the job for field representatives, and some of \n        them thought that they would face reprisals if they failed to contribute, \n        including being fired and being prevented from obtaining future union \n        jobs. Under the FECA labor organizations are prohibited from using coercion, \n        such as the threat of a detrimental job action, any other financial reprisal, \n        or force, to urge any individual to make a contribution.</p>\n      <p>Further, according to the conciliation agreement, KSDCC made partisan \n        communications to its members and failed to report the costs to the FEC. \n        Labor organizations must report the costs of membership communications \n        if those communications expressly advocate the election or defeat of a \n        federal candidate (other than a communication primarily devoted to subjects \n        other than the express advocacy of the election or defeat of a federal \n        candidate) once the costs of the communications exceed $2,000 for any \n        election. </p> \n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">1.</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\"><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5268&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR \n            5268</a></td>\n          <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"4%\" valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\" valign=\"TOP\">RESPONDENTS:</td>\n          <td width=\"67%\" valign=\"TOP\"><p>(a) &#160;&#160;Indiana - Kentucky Regional&#160;Council \n              of Carpenters(as successor to the&#160;&#160; Kentucky State District \n              Council of Carpenters) \n            </p><p>(b) &#160;&#160;Steve Barger </p>\n            <p>(c) &#160;&#160;Don Mitchell </p>\n            <p>(d) &#160;&#160;Tom Schulz </p>\n            <p>(e) &#160;&#160;Carpenters Legislative Improvement Committee Untied \n              Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, Monte Byers, treasurer </p>\n            <p>(f) &#160;&#160;Daniel Forbis </p>\n            <p>(g) &#160;&#160;Jerry Landers </p>\n            (h) &#160;&#160;Mike Fleitz</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"TOP\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"TOP\"> RECIPIENT COMMITTEES: </td>\n          <td valign=\"TOP\"><p>Alexander for Congress, Anne Watkins, treasurer \n            </p>\n            <p>Baesler for Senate Committee, Michael Foley, treasurer </p>\n            <p>Baesler for Congress, Michael Foley, treasurer </p>\n            <p>Tom Barlow for Congress, Clyde Elrod, treasurer </p>\n            <p>Conway for Congress, Scott Karen, treasurer </p>\n            <p>Gore/Lieberman Inc., Jose Villarreal, treasurer </p>\n            <p>Gorman for Congress, Edwin Olliges, Jr., treasurer </p>\n            <p>Eleanor Jordan for Congress, Christal Williams, treasurer </p>\n            <p>Lucas for Congress, Steve Cauthen, treasurer </p>\n            <p>Brian Roy for Congress, Tim Miller, treasurer </p>\n            <p>Scorsone for Congress, Laurence T.
