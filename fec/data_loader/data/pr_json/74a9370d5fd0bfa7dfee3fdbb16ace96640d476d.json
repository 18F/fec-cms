The program has three elements: grants to parties to help fund their nominating conventions, grants available to nominees to pay for the general election campaign, and matching payments to participating candidates during the primary campaign. </p>\n        <p>This cycle, the maximum amount a<strong> </strong>primary candidate could receive is currently estimated to be about $22.8 million. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
