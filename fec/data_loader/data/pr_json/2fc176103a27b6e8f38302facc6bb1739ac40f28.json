This brings to 275 the total number of cases resolved through the ADR program since it began on October 2, 2000. </p>\n      <p>The ADR process is designed to reach an expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act.&#160; For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is being resolved, and participate in mediation if necessary.&#160; Resolutions are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval.&#160; Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available in the FEC&#8217;s Press and Public Records office. </p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <p/>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=314&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">ADR 314</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> National rifle Association of America Political Victory Fund, Mary Rose Adkins, treasurer </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SOURCE:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> FEC Initiated (RAD) </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p> Failure to file 24-Hour and 48-Hour Notices for independent expenditures </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>$17,000 civil penalty</p>\n          <p> Respondents acknowledge their failure to file the required 48-Hour and 24-Hour Notices for independent expenditures and agree to send at least three members of the Association&#8217; staff to a FEC seminar on reporting responsibilities; conduct an internal training program for Association staff on FECA reporting responsibilities; prepare, maintain and distribute to Association staff copies of a manual on the obligations and requirements of FECA and pay a civil penalty of $17,000. </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD: </strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at http://www.fec.gov by entering 314 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FECs Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"36\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>2.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"147\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=322&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">ADR 322</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"343\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"36\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"147\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"343\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"36\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"147\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"343\" valign=\"top\"><p> International Association of firefighters Interested in Registration and Education PAC, Vincent J.
