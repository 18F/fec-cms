If the Commission receives\nrequests to testify, it will conduct a hearing on the proposed rules on February 16, 2000,\nat 10 a.m. in the Commission&#146;s ninth floor hearing room.</b></p>\n\n\n<p>The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits corporations and labor organizations\nfrom using general treasury funds to make contributions to a candidate for federal office.\nIt also imposes various limits on the amount of money or in-kind contributions other\npersons may contribute to federal campaigns. Unlike independent expenditures, which are\nunlimited, expenditures that are coordinated with a candidate or campaign are considered\nin-kind contributions. As such, they are subject to the various limits and prohibitions\nset out in the FECA.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed rules would incorporate into the Commission&#146;s rules the standard on\ncoordination articulated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia\nin <i>Federal Election Commission v. The Christian Coalition, </i>with references to the\nSupreme Court&#146;s plurality opinion in <i>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign\nCommittee v. Federal Election Commission</i>.<i> </i></p>\n\n\n<p><b>The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on December\n9, 1999, pps. 68951-56. Text of the Federal Register notice can also be found at the\nFEC&#146;s Web site, <i>www.fec.gov</i>.</b></p>\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p>All comments should be addressed to Rosemary C. Smith, Assistant General Counsel, and\nmust be submitted in either written or electronic form. Oral comments cannot be accepted.\nWritten comments should be sent to Ms. Smith at the Federal Election Commission, 999 E\nSt., NW, Washington, DC 20463. Faxed comments should be sent to (202) 219-3923, with\nprinted copy follow-up to ensure legibility. Electronic mail comments should be sent to <i>coordnprm@fec.gov</i>.\nThose sending comments by electronic mail should include their full names and postal\nservice addresses within the text of their comments. Comments that do not contain the full\nname, electronic mail address and postal service address of the commenter will not be\nconsidered.</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p>\n</font>\n</body>\n"}
