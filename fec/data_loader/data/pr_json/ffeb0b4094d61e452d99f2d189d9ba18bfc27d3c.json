Based on the information in the complaint, responses from respondents, and review, the Commission found no reason to believe that the respondents violated the Act. The complaint identified a direct contribution from FODH to Hynes for Senate which the complaint made no specific allegation. The Commission found reason to believe that FODH and Hynes for Senate violated the law by transferring funds from Mr. Hyne&#8217;s state committee to his federal committee. The Commission decided to take no further action, send an admonishment letter and require disgorgement of the funds. The Commission also found reason to believe Hynes for Senate violated the law for failing to disclose the contributions, but take no further action and send an admonishment letter. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\"><p>Documents from these matters are available from the \n              Commission's web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering \n              5406 under case number.

These PACs then made contributions to the 2004 Geoffrey Davis for Congress Committee within nine days of their receipt of the Nesbitt contributions. The complainant alleged that because of the timing of the contributions and the contributions patterns, these contributions were earmarked under the Commission&#8217;s regulations, were excessive to the 2004 Davis Committee, and were contributions in the name of another. In a notarized affidavit, Nesbitt states that he did not instruct the respondent PACs to contribute to the 2004 Davis Committee and that he did not know that the PACs would contribute to the campaign. After review of the available information, the Commission found no reason to believe the respondents violated the law and closed the file. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td><p>Documents from these matters are available from the Commission's web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering 5445 under case number.
