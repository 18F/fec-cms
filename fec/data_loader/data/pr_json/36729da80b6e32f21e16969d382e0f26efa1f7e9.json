Jenkins, in her official capacity as treasurer; and Gardner Gore<br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: Donald L. Curlovic<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Mulvaney for Congress and Jenkins, in her official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) failed to include disclaimers on various campaign signs. Mick Mulvaney was a 2010 candidate for South Carolina&#8217;s 5th Congressional District.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the matter in furtherance of the Commission&#8217;s priorities relative to other matters and in light of publicly available information corroborating that the signs at issue did not belong to the Committee but instead appeared to be part of an independent effort by Gore, who acknowledged responsibility for the signs and took remedial actions to place disclaimers on them. The Commission sent a letter reminding Gore about the Commission&#8217;s disclaimer requirements.</p>\n        <p>            <strong><u>MUR 6371</u></strong> &#8211; Friends of Christine O&#8217;Donnell and Matthew J.
