The Commission is\n    soliciting candidate applications by advertising in a number of national publications and\n    posting the vacancy announcement on the Commission's website.</p>\n    <p>The FEC is an independent federal regulatory agency established by the Federal Election\n    Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971, as amended. It is governed by six Commissioners appointed by\n    the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Commissioners will make the\n    selection of the General Counsel.</p>\n    <p>The agency has exclusive jurisdiction for the administration, interpretation, and civil\n    enforcement of the FECA, which requires disclosure of campaign contributions and\n    expenditures by candidates for federal office and committees supporting those candidates,\n    and imposes limitations on the amount and sources of such contributions. The FEC also\n    administers the federal programs that provide public funding to qualified candidates for\n    President and Vice President.</p>\n    <p>The General Counsel has primary responsibility for the overall direction and management\n    of the Office of the General Counsel, which has approximately 120 personnel, including\n    over 70 attorneys. Former General Counsel Lawrence M. Noble resigned the position on\n    January 1, 2001, to accept a post outside of government.</p>\n    <p>The vacancy announcement (no. 01-012) carries a closing date of March 20, 2001. The\n    General Counsel post is an Executive Level V (EX-V) position with a salary of $117,600 per\n    annum. Interested candidates should review the entire announcement and application\n    requirements by visiting the FEC website at <i>www.fec.gov/jobs.htm</i> or calling\n    202-694-1080. </p>\n    <p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p></font></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n</font></font></font></body>\n"}
