Walther dissented and issued a <a href=\"../../members/walther/statements/AO2010-08_Citizens_United.pdf\">statement</a>.</p>\n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"100%\" valign=\"top\"><p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
