The prohibited contributions resulted from television advertisements, press conferences, and websites that purportedly were sponsored by the Brady respondents. The Brady respondents originally submitted a cursory response to the complaint in which they categorically denied all allegations. Over a year later, the Brady respondents supplemented their response and acknowledged that one particular advertisement failed to include a complete disclaimer. The federal candidate committee respondents each denied any coordination with the Brady respondents and requested that the complaint be dismissed. The Commission found reason to believe that the Brady respondents violated the Act in connection with advertisements, websites and press conferences that supported or opposed federal candidates in the 2000 election cycle and conciliated with the Brady respondents. &#160; </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\"><p>Documents from these matters are available from the \n              Commission's web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering \n              5158 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.

The response maintained the campaign used 100 square feet of space in the building, which Mr. Wortman personally owned and he discounted the rent for this space. The Committee amended its disclosure reports to reflect this arrangement. The Commission found no reason to believe that a corporate contribution occurred, but did find that the committee did not accurately reflect the in-kind contribution for the rental payment. Because of the <em>de minimus</em> amount of the reporting violation, the Commission decided to take no further action and send an admonishment letter. The Commission found no reason to believe a violation occurred with regard to the use of office equipment. The Commission decided not to pursue the logo allegation as neither logo had been trademarked and it appears that the committee tried to differentiate the common item (the name Wortman) in both logos. The Commission found reason to believe the Committee failed to have a disclaimer on its website, but took no further action and sent an admonishment letter. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td><p>Documents from these matters are available from the Commission's web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5479 under the case number in the Enforcement Query System.
