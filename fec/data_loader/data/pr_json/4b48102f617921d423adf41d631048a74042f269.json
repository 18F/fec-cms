If an individual raises\nor spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to\nreporting under the FECA.</p>\n\n<p>The FEC notified committees involved in the primary of their potential filing\nrequirements on August 10. Those committees which did not file on the due date were\nnotified on September 4 that reports had not been received and that their names would be\npublished if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n\n<p>Other political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those\nwhich are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to file\npre-primary reports, unless they report monthly. Those committee names are not published\nby the FEC.</p>\n\n<p>Further Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a\ncase-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement\nactions, including the imposition of civil penalties ($5,500 for \"any violation\"\nand $11,000 for any \"knowing and willful\" violation).</p>\n\n<p>The next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees will be the\nquarterly report due October 15. It will cover activity from August 27 through September\n30.</p>\n</font><font size=\"2\">\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p>\n</font>\n</body>\n", "date": "09/11/1998", "href": "nf911.htm", "category": "Non-Filer Publications", "title": "Campaigns Cited for Failure to File Pre-Primary Reports", "pdf": null}
