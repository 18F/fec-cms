Nonconnected PACs (PACs not sponsored by particular corporations, labor organizations, trade or membership groups, etc.) reported $154.9 million in receipts and $146.3 million in disbursements, the highest totals when compared to the other PAC categories in 2009. Corporate PACs reported making $72.1 million in contributions to candidates in 2009, exceeding the totals of the other PAC categories. Among the tables attached to this release is a list of the nonconnected PACs with the largest increases in fundraising from 2007 to 2009.</p>\n        <p>Another table shows contributions to candidates based on the office sought and party affiliation. &#160;PAC contributions made to Senate Democratic candidates totaled $27.8 million and $82.8 million for House Democratic candidates, representing an increase from 2007 totals of 39% and 5%, respectively. PAC contributions to Senate Republican candidates were $19.4 million, a decrease of 18 % from 2007 totals. Contributions made by PACs to House Republican candidates were $44.5 million, a decrease of almost 13% compared to 2007.Generally, historical data show that PACs tend to contribute more to the party controlling each house of Congress.</p>\n        <p>PACs ended 2009 with $403.5 million cash-on-hand, up 6% from 2007 and the highest cash balance total reported for an odd-numbered year since the FEC began keeping records.PACs reported total outstanding debts of $5.8 million, down 16% from 2007.</p>\n        <p><strong>Tables</strong></p>\n        <p>Summary of PAC Financial Activity 1993-2009 [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/1pac2009.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/1pac2009.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n        <p>PAC Contributions to Candidates 1993-2009 [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/2contribhistory2009.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/2contribhistory2009.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n        <p>Chart - PAC Receipts and Contributions to Candidates by PAC Type [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/3paccharts.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n        <p>Top 50 PACs by Receipts January 1, 2009 - December 31, 2009 [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/4top50rec2009.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/4top50rec2009.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n        <p>Top 50 PACs by Contributions to Candidates January 1, 2009 - December 31, 2009 [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/5top50contrib2009.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/5top50contrib2009.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n        <p>Top 50 PACs by Cash on Hand as of December 31, 2009 [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/6top50cash2009.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/6top50cash2009.pdf\">PDF</a>] </p>\n        <p>Nonconnected PACs with the Largest Increase in Fundraising in 2009 [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/7noncongrowth2009.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"20100406Pary_Files/7noncongrowth2009.pdf\">PDF</a>] </p>        \n        <p align=\"center\"/>\n        <p align=\"center\">&#160;</p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n"}
