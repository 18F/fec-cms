Candidates seeking election to the 33 Senate seats up for election in 2006 have reported raising $84.8 million and spending $20.2 million during the first six months of 2005.</p>\n      <p> From January 1, through June 30, 2005, contributions from individuals accounted for $62.8 million or 74% of the total raised by Senate candidates.&#160; PAC money totaled $15.6 million and represented 18% of receipts.</p>\n      <p> While comparisons of Senate races are problematic because different states have contests each cycle and member retirements sometimes have large effects,&#160; mid-year reports filed by this current group of 85 candidates indicate more fundraising activity than the first six-month filings by candidates in the recent past.&#160; &#160;&#160;During the first half of 1999, when these seats were last contested, 73 candidates raised $50 million and spent $12.2 million.&#160; In 2001, 56 candidates, competing for 33 seats, raised $43 million and spent $9.3 million, and in 2003, 63 candidates raised $75.6 million and spent $18.4 million.</p>\n      <p>Senate candidates ended the first six months of 2005 with $103.1 million cash-on-hand and debts of $6.9 million, some of which is from previous elections. </p>\n      <p>Campaign finance reports filed by House candidates during the same six month period show 428 House incumbents reporting receipts of $116.5 million, a $23.7 million (or 25.5%) increase from the comparable period for incumbents in 2003.&#160; From January through June of this year, 224 Republicans reported raising $67.7 million, while 204 Democrats raised $48.8 million.&#160;&#160; Democrats had cash on hand at the end of the reporting period of $94.7 million and Republicans $115.7 million.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>\n      <p> Republican incumbents reported median receipts of $245,137 compared to $188,745 for Democrats.&#160; For the comparable period in 2003, Republicans had median receipts of $184,932 and Democrats $150,613.</p>\n      <p> Receipts for the 24 Republican freshmen came to $9.9 million while the 17 Democratic freshmen had receipts of $5.8 million.&#160; Democratic freshmen had median receipts of $251,888 while the median for Republicans was $395,712.&#160; </p>\n      <p> Non-incumbents raised a total of $14.3 million for House races during the first six months of 2005, with 79 Democrats raising $6.8 million and 60 Republicans raising $7.5 million.&#160; In a comparable period of 2003, 38 Democrats raised $1.8 million and 82 Republicans raised $9.5 million.&#160; </p>\n      <p> Included in the following tables are the rankings of House members for the following categories:&#160;
