In ADR 311, the Lyndon LaRouche Political Action Committee paid a $7,000 civil penalty for failure to file independent expenditure reports.</p>\n      <p>The Commission dismissed ADRs 336 and 343 against Gonzalez for Congress because the committee filed all past reports and properly terminated the committee.</p>\n      <p>The ADR program has proved very effective in expediting resolution of certain types of violations and reduced the agency&#8217;s costs for resolving some enforcement matters. This brings to 270 the total number of cases resolved through the ADR program since it began on October 2, 2000.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>\n      <p>The ADR process is designed to reach an expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act.&#160; For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is being resolved, and participate in mediation if necessary.&#160; Resolutions are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval.&#160; Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available in the FEC&#8217;s Press and Public Records office. </p>\n      <p/>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=311&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">ADR 311</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n          <td valign=\"top\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>Lyndon LaRouche Political Action Committee, Barbara M.
