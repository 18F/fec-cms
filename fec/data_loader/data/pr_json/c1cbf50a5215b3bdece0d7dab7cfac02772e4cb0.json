Republican party committees reported raising $206.2 million in federal funds in 2009, down less than 1% from the $208.3 million they raised in 2007. Their Democratic counterparts reported raising $219.5 million&#8212;4% more than the $211.3 million they raised during the same period in the last cycle. </p>\n        <p>National committees of the major parties are required to submit financial reports on a monthly basis. As a result, it is possible to compare their activity over a 13-month period from January 1, 2009, through January 31, 2010. During this period, the three national committees of the Democratic party&#8212;the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) &#8212;reported raising a total of nearly $202 million. This represents an increase of 6% over the same period in 2007-2008 and 33% over the first 13 months of the 2006 election cycle. The three Republican national party committees&#8212;the Republican National Committee (RNC), the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) &#8212;reported raising a combined $188.7 million during the same period. This represents an increase of over 1% from 2007-2008 and a decrease of more than 17% from 2005-2006.</p>\n        <p>The DSCC and DCCC each reported a decrease in their total receipts compared to the same 13-month period in prior cycles, while the DNC reported an increase. The DSCC and DCCC reported a total of $48.7 and $60.3 million in receipts&#8212;a drop of 18% and 16%, respectively, from the last cycle. The DNC raised nearly $93 million through January 31, 2010, representing a 54% increase in receipts from the same period in 2007-2008 and a 52% increase from that period in 2005-2006. </p>\n        <p>Of the six national party committees, the RNC raised the most, disclosing $101.7 million in receipts, an increase of over 4% from its 13-month total in 2007-2008, but a decrease of almost 15% from its 2005-2006 total for the same period. The NRSC saw its receipts increase by 31% over its 2007-2008 period total, disclosing $46.3 million in receipts. The NRCC reported receiving $40.7 million, a decrease of almost 24% from the amount raised for the same 13-month period in the last cycle. </p>\n        <p>Additional information for party committees at the state and local level is available through the end of 2009.* </p>\n        <p>The following chart summarizes financial activity for all national parties in non-election years since 1999. Note that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) eliminated all non-federal, or &#8220;soft money,&#8221; fundraising (such as contributions from corporations or unions or unlimited contributions from individuals) by national party committees. All national party receipts now must comply with federal limits and prohibitions.</p>\n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"103\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" bgcolor=\"white\"/>\n            <td width=\"77\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">2009</p></td>\n            <td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">2007</p></td>\n            <td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">2005</p></td>\n            <td width=\"71\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">2003</p></td>\n            <td width=\"125\" colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">2001</p></td>\n            <td width=\"120\" colspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">1999</p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"77\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n            <td width=\"73\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n            <td width=\"74\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n            <td width=\"71\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n            <td width=\"65\"><p align=\"center\">Non-Federal Receipts</p></td>\n            <td width=\"59\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n            <td width=\"60\"><p align=\"center\">Non-Federal Receipts</p></td>\n            <td width=\"60\"><p align=\"center\">Federal Receipts</p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"103\" valign=\"top\"><p>Democrats</p></td>\n            <td width=\"77\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$183.0</p></td>\n            <td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$177.7</p></td>\n            <td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$142.6</p></td>\n            <td width=\"71\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$95.2</p></td>\n            <td width=\"65\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$68.6</p></td>\n            <td width=\"59\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$59.7</p></td>\n            <td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$54.4</p></td>\n            <td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$55.4</p></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"103\" valign=\"top\"><p>Republicans</p></td>\n            <td width=\"77\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$168.6</p></td>\n            <td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$167.1</p></td>\n            <td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$205.9</p></td>\n            <td width=\"71\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$206.9</p></td>\n            <td width=\"65\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$100.1</p></td>\n            <td width=\"59\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$133.9</p></td>\n            <td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$59.6</p></td>\n            <td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\"><p align=\"center\">$95.3</p></td>\n          </tr>\n        </table>\n        <p align=\"center\">(In millions of dollars)</p>\n        <p>State and local party fundraising is not included in this table.</p>\n        <p>Tables attached to this release provide details of financial activity in non-election years since 1991.</p>\n        <p>Individuals, whose limits on contributions to national parties are $30,400 this election cycle, are the largest source of federal funds for party committees. National Republican committees reported receiving $169.1 million from individuals (82% of their receipts) in 2009, while national Democratic committees received $164.4 million (75% of their total). Table 4 breaks down those contributions by size in recent non-election years.The table shows that all national committees receive more  contributions in amounts less than $200 than from contributions in any other category. </p>\n        <p>Political Action Committees (PACs) and other political committees contributed $16.6 million to Republican party committees and $21 million to Democratic party committees in 2009, a decrease of $5.4 million and an increase of $2.5 million, respectively, from their totals in 2007, the most recent comparable year of the two-year election cycle.A large portion of the contributions came from House members&#8217; campaign committees. House Democrats contributed $15.7 million and House Republicans contributed $4.8 million from their campaign accounts to their respective national congressional party committees during 2009. Table 5 provides a list of Democratic House members and their contributions to the DCCC, while Table 6 shows contributions to the NRCC from Republican House members. Tables 7 and 8 show contributions made by Senate members to their respective national senatorial campaign committees.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>* State and local party committees are permitted to file reports on a quarterly basis, so the most current information for them covers only calendar year 2009.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>Table 1 National Party Financial Activity Through January 31, 2010 [<a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/1nationaljan.xls\">excel</a>] [<a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/1nationaljan.pdf\">pdf</a>] </p>\n        <p>Table 2 Democratic Party Committee Financial Activity Through December 31, 2009 [<a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/2demptyoff2009.xls\">excel</a>] [<a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/2demptyoff2009.pdf\">pdf</a>] </p>\n        <p>Table 3 Republican Party Committee Financial Activity Through December 31, 2009 <a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/3repptyoff2009.xls\">[excel</a>] [<a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/3repptyoff2009.pdf\">pdf]</a></p>\n        <p>Table 4 Contributions from Individuals to National Party Committees by Contribution Amount <a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/4ptyindoff2009.xls\">[excel</a>] [<a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/4ptyindoff2009.pdf\">pdf]</a></p>\n        <p>Table 5 Member Contributions to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee <a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/5DCCCmembers2009.xls\">[excel</a>] [<a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/5DCCCmembers2009.pdf\">pdf]</a></p>\n        <p>Table 6 Member Contributions to the National Republican Congressional Committee <a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/6nrccmembers2009.xls\">[excel</a>] [<a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/6nrccmembers2009.pdf\">pdf]</a></p>\n        <p>Table 7 Member Contributions to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee <a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/7DSCCmembers2009.xls\">[excel</a>] [<a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/7DSCCmembers2009.pdf\">pdf]</a></p>\n        <p>Table 8 Member Contributions to the National Republican Senatorial Committee <a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/8nrscmembers2009.xls\">[excel</a>] [<a href=\"20100309Paty_Files/8nrscmembers2009.pdf\">pdf]</a></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p align=\"center\">&#160;        </p>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n", "href": "press2010/20100309Party.shtml", "date": "03/09/2010", "pdf": null, "title": "Party Committees Report Slight Increase Overall in 2009 Receipts", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries"}
