John McCain (AZ), received $84.1 million in public funds to conduct his general election campaign and raised an additional $46.4 million for legal and accounting expenses.The Democratic presidential nominee, then-Sen. Barack Obama (IL), raised a total of $745.7 million in private funds for his primary nomination and general election campaign. It was the first time in the history of presidential public financing that a major party nominee declined to accept public funds for the general election. </p>\n                      <p>The two parties received $16.8 million each from the treasury for their nominating conventions, while host committees raised a total of $124.3 million in support of their activities.A table attached to this release summarizes these three categories of activity for the last four presidential campaigns.</p>\n                      <p>Individuals, parties and other groups spent $168.8 million independently advocating the election or defeat of presidential candidates during the 2008 campaign.In the three previous cycles, similar spending totaled $192.4 million, $14.7 million, and $1.4 million, respectively. There is no limit on the amount that may be spent on these activities given that the spending is independent of the candidates. </p>\n                      <p>In 2008, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) spent $1.1 million on independent expenditures, while the Republican National Committee (RNC) spent $53.5 million.The national parties also spent a combined $25.3 million in coordination with the 2008 presidential campaigns during the general election period.Each party was permitted to spend up to $19.15 million on this activity.In the three previous elections, parties spent $32.1 million, $27.2 million, and $18.7 million, respectively, on coordinated expenditures.</p>\n                      <p>Membership organizations reported spending $18.1 million in communications to their members advocating the election or defeat of a presidential candidate -- an almost $6 million increase over what they reported during the 2004 presidential election.</p>\n                      <p>In 2008, groups reported spending $27.8 million on electioneering communications that referenced a political candidate -- a decrease of $13 million from the 2004 election. An electioneering communication is a broadcast, cable or satellite communication that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate and is distributed prior to an election. Additional tables attached to this release provide details about the sources of receipts for presidential pre-nomination campaigns and information about how the money was spent.</p>\n                      <p>This was only the second cycle in which both major party nominees declined public matching funds during the primaries. The $21.7 million paid in those funds to other primary candidates was the lowest since the first presidential election conducted under the public funding program in 1976. The Obama campaign&#8217;s total receipts of $745.7 million for the 2008 election are equivalent to more than half of the $1.49 billion provided in public funds to all presidential candidates, parties, and conventions since the inception of the public funding program.</p>\n                      <p>President Obama&#8217;s campaign transferred more than $41 million to Democratic Party committees at both the national and state levels, with $8.5 million going to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The committee ended 2008 with $18.3 million in cash on hand and $1.9 in outstanding debt. Sen. McCain&#8217;s presidential primary campaign transferred more than $18.6 million to state and local party committees.</p>\n                      <p>Overview of Presidential Financial Activity 1996 - 2008 [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/1_OverviewPresFinActivity1996-2008.xls\">excel</a></u>] [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/1_OverviewPresFinActivity1996-2008.pdf\">pdf</a></u>] </p>\n                      <p>2008 Presidential Primary Campaign Receipts [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/2_2008PresPrimaryCmpgnRcpts.xls\">excel</a></u>] [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/2_2008PresPrimaryCmpgnRcpts.pdf\">pdf</a></u>] </p>\n                      <p>2008 Presidential Primary Campaign Disbursements [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/3_2008PresPrimaryCmpgnDis.xls\">excel</a></u>] [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/3_2008PresPrimaryCmpgnDis.pdf\">pdf</a></u>] </p>\n                      <p>Presidential Public Funding History [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/4_PublicFundsPresCmpgns.xls\">excel</a></u>] [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/4_PublicFundsPresCmpgns.pdf\">pdf</a></u>] </p>\n                      <p>Obama Campaign Transfers to Parties [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/5_ObamaCmpgnTranParties.xls\">excel</a></u>] [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/5_ObamaCmpgnTranParties.pdf\">pdf</a></u>]</p>\n                      <p>McCain Campaign Transfers to Parties [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/6_McCainCmpgnTranParties.xls\">excel</a></u>] [<u><a href=\"20090608Pres/6_McCainCmpgnTranParties.pdf\">pdf</a></u>]</p>\n                      <p>&#160;</p></td>\n                  <td width=\"0%\"/>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"98%\" colspan=\"3\" valign=\"top\"><p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
