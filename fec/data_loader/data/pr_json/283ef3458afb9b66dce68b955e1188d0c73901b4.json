Party spending of federal funds during this\n    period totaled $409.9 million, up 45% since 1998. The RNC and DNC typically raise and\n    spend more money in Presidential campaign cycles &#150; federal receipts totaled $467.6\n    million and disbursements were $405.6 million during a comparable period in 2000.</p>\n    <p>Republican committees at all levels (Republican National Committee, National Republican\n    Senatorial Committee, and National Republican Congressional Committee) raised and spent\n    more than their Democratic counterparts, continuing a pattern seen throughout the period\n    since the FEC began receiving financial reports. Republicans raised a total of $289\n    million in \"hard money,\" just over twice the Democratic Party total of $127.4\n    million. Tables below provide breakdowns of hard money activity for each committee since\n    1992.</p>\n    <p>Non-federal (or \"soft money\") activity by the national parties has been\n    greater in the 2002 campaign than even the 2000 Presidential cycle. Republican committees\n    reported soft money receipts of $221.7 million through October 16, up 5% over their 2000\n    efforts and more than twice the soft money receipts for these committees during the 1998\n    campaign. </p>\n    <p>Democrats raised nearly as much soft money as Republicans, their total of $199.6\n    million slightly more than the 2000 total, and 2 &#189; times their comparable 1998 soft money\n    receipts. The largest increases have been experienced by the Senatorial and Congressional\n    campaign committees of both parties. Tables below describe soft money activity of each\n    national party organization.</p>\n    <p>Tables below list transfers from each national party committee to state and local\n    parties during the 2001-2002 election cycle. Much party activity in recent campaigns has\n    been paid for by state parties and these tables illustrate the focus of national party\n    resources on states with particularly competitive campaigns.</p>\n    <p class=\"bold\">Tables</p>\n    <p>The files marked [EXCEL] can be viewed using Microsoft Excel available from Microsoft\n    at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\">http://www.microsoft.com</a> or using the free\n    Microsoft Excel 97/2000 Viewer available from Microsoft at <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/xlviewer.aspx\">http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/xlviewer.aspx</a>.</p><ul>\n      <li>Federal Activity of Democratic National Committees [<a href=\"demfedpre.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Federal Activity of Republican National Committees [<a href=\"repfedpre.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Nonfederal Activity of Democratic National Committees [<a href=\"demsoftpre.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Nonfederal Activity of Republican National Committees [<a href=\"repsoftpre.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Nonfederal Activity 1992-2002 [<a href=\"softlongpre.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>DNC and RNC Transfers to State Parties 2001-2002 [<a href=\"nattranspre.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n      <li>Senatorial and Congressional Campaign Committee Transfers to State Parties 2001-2002 [<a href=\"congtranspre.xls\">EXCEL</a>]</li>\n    </ul>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"100%\"/>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "press2002/20021030partypre/20021030partypre.html", "date": "10/30/2002", "pdf": null, "title": "National Party Fundraising Strong in Pre-Election Filings", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries"}
