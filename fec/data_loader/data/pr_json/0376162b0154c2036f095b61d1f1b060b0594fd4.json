The proposed changes to the candidate\nagreement regulations would establish electronic filing as an\nadditional prerequisite for the receipt of public funding. The\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, however, makes clear that these\nnew regulations would apply only to those committees that decide\nto rely upon a computer system to maintain and use their campaign\nfinance data. \"Thus, the draft rules would not burden\ncampaign committees with new requirements if they [committees]\nare not computerized,\" the Notice stipulates.</font></p>\n\n<p><font size=\"3\" face=\"Book Antiqua\">All comments must be\nsubmitted in either written or electronic form and addressed to\nMs. Susan E.
