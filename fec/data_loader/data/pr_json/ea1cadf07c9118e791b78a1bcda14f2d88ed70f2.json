If sent by registered mail, the reports should have been postmarked by October 23. Otherwise, the due date was close-of-business October 26.</p>\n\n<p>\tSome individuals and their committees have no obligation to file reports under federal election law, even though their names may appear on state ballots.  If an individual raises or spends less than $5,000, he or she is not considered a \"candidate\" subject to reporting under the FECA.</p>\n\n<p>\tThe FEC notified committees involved in the general election of their filing requirements on October 2.  Those committees which did not file on the due date were notified on October 27 that reports had not been received and that their names would be published if they did not respond within four business days.</p>\n\n<p>\tOther political committees supporting Senate and House candidates in elections (those which are not authorized units of a candidate's campaign) also are required to file pre-general election reports. Those committee names are not published by the FEC.</p>\n\n<p>\tFurther Commission action against non-filers and late filers is decided on a case-by-case basis. Federal law gives the FEC broad authority to initiate enforcement actions and the FEC has implemented a new administrative fine program which may subject committees to penalties ranging from $125 to $16,000 or more.</p>\n\n<p>\tThe next regularly scheduled disclosure reports for candidate committees will be the 30-Day Post-General Election report due December 7, 2000.  It will cover activity from October 19 through November  27.</p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\"/>\n</font><font size=\"3\"><p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p>\n</font><font size=\"2\">\n<b><sup><p>1</p></sup></b>The Gatewood for Congress 2000 committee has filed the October Quarterly Report covering part of the 12-Day Pre-General Reporting period.
