Semi-annual reporting is no longer an option for Congressional\n    committees.</p>\n    <p>April quarterly reports cover financial activity from January 1, 2003, through March\n    31, 2003. The reports are due by close of business Monday, April 15, if sent regular mail\n    or hand-delivered. If sent certified or registered mail, disclosure reports must be\n    postmarked no later than midnight of the due date. Electronically filed reports must be\n    received by midnight, eastern time, on the filing date. Senate campaigns file their\n    reports with the Secretary of the Senate, who then forwards the reports to the FEC. All\n    other committees file their reports with the FEC.</p>\n    <p>Digital images of campaign finance reports are now available on the FEC Website,\n    www.fec.gov. All reports filed by PACs, political parties, Presidential, and House\n    campaigns are available for viewing on the Web within 48 hours of the reports being\n    received by the FEC. </p>\n    <p>The Public Records Office accepts most major credit cards as method of payment for\n    copying documents and deposits for Public Records accounts. The telephone number for the\n    Public Records Office is (202) 694-1120, or toll-free (800) 424-9530 (option #3).
