Grace made unreported expenditures when he leased space on a computer server to create a &#8220;blog&#8221; which advocated the defeat of Representative Mary Bono in the November 2006 election.&#160; The Commission also rejected allegations that Grace coordinated these expenditures with Bono&#8217;s opponent in the race, David Roth, and found that no in-kind contributions to Roth&#8217;s campaign resulted from Grace&#8217;s blogging activity.&#160; The Commission also found that the respondent did not fraudulently misrepresent himself in violation of 2U.S.C. &#167; 441h.&#160; </p>\n              <p>The Act exempts from regulation volunteer activity by individuals.&#160; In the FEC&#8217;s Internet regulations, the Commission clarified that an individual&#8217;s use, without compensation, of equipment and personal services for blogging, creating, or hosting a website for the purpose of influencing a Federal election are not expenditures subject to the restrictions of campaign finance law.&#160; Even if there were some costs or value associated with Mr. Grace&#8217;s blog, these costs are exempt from Commission regulations.&#160; The FEC therefore found no reason to believe Mr. Grace or the Roth campaign violated federal campaign finance law.&#160; </p>\n              <p>Additional information regarding MURs can be found on the FEC website at <a href=\"../../em/mur.shtml\">http://www.fec.gov/em/mur.shtml</a>. </p>\n              <p>This release contains only summary information.&#160; For additional details, please consult publicly available documents for each case in the Enforcement Query System (EQS) on the FEC website at <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs</a> .</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p/>\n              <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>MUR</strong><strong> 5928</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><ul>\n                      <li>Kos Media, LLC</li>\n                      <li>DailyKos.com</li>\n                      <li>Markos Moulitsas Zuniga</li>\n                    </ul>\n                      <p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>COMPLAINANT:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>John C.A.
