Fischer, rejected Mr. Adams&#8217; attempt to dismiss the case based on the Commission&#8217;s alleged failure to conciliate adequately before filing suit.&#160; The Court refused to analyze the details of the parties&#8217; conciliation proposals and deferred to the FEC.</p>\n              <p>The Court also granted the FEC&#8217;s motion to reject six of Mr. Adams&#8217; eight affirmative defenses.&#160; The Court again found that the Commission had adequately attempted to conciliate the matter.&#160; The Court also found that the disclosure and disclaimer requirements in FECA do not violate the defendant&#8217;s First Amendment rights, and that Mr. Adams was not denied Due Process despite his allegations that the applicable statutory provisions are not well known or frequently enforced. </p>\n              <p>The FEC was represented in the litigation by FEC attorneys Claire N. Rajan, Harry J. Summers, David Kolker and Thomasenia P. Duncan.</p>\n              <p>The case, which remains before the District Court pending further action, is FEC v.
