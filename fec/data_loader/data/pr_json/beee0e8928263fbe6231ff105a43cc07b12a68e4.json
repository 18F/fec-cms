The Commission issued an advisory opinion in response to a request from Niger Innis for Congress (the Committee).

The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns  for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, the Presidency and the  Vice Presidency. Established in 1975, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners  who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. </em><br/>\n        </p>\n        <p># #  #</p>\n        <p><br/>\n        </p>\n        <div align=\"left\">\n        </div>\n        <p><br/>\n</p></td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>      \n      </div>\n      "}
