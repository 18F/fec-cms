Pehrkon as\nits staff director, replacing John C. Surina who left the agency last year for a position\nin the Department of Agriculture.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Pehrkon has been serving as Acting Staff Director for several months, and before\nthat served as the agency&#146;s Deputy Staff Director for Management. He has overseen the\nFEC&#146;s response to the recent performance audit and management review undertaken by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) at the direction of Congress.</p>\n\n<p>That audit found the FEC to be a competently managed organization with a skilled and\nmotivated staff, but suggested several changes and improvements, such as more use of\nelectronic filing by reporting entities. Mr. Pehrkon recently prepared a report on the\nFEC&#146;s plans for responding to PwC&#146;s recommendations. His report noted certain\nchanges already under way and included plans for the use of outside consultants to assist\nwith several projects.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission has directed Mr. Pehrkon to continue his efforts to recommend and\nimplement improvements in the FEC&#146;s operations. His experience and knowledge will be\ninvaluable in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Pehrkon is a graduate of Harvard University. He also studied at the graduate level\nat Georgetown University. He and his wife, Elena, make their home in Great Falls, VA.</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # #</p>\n\n</body>\n", "date": "04/14/1999", "href": "staffdr.htm", "category": "Commission Appointments", "title": "Commission Names Pehrkon Staff Director", "pdf": null}
