This represents a\n    decline of 10% from the record amounts spent in a comparable period during the 2000\n    election cycle. Fundraising by these candidates totaled $821.8 million through late\n    November, also 10% lower than the previous cycle. <p>Candidates in special elections spent\n    an additional $18.7 million in 2001 and 2002, and candidates who lost in primaries\n    reported $107 million in spending through September 30, 2002. All campaigns will file\n    year-end reports covering the remainder of 2002 at the end of January.</p>\n    <p>The decline in financial activity was limited to Senate campaigns, where receipts\n    totaled $282.3 million and disbursements were $272.6 million. These represent declines of\n    23% in receipts and 25% in disbursements when compared with the 2000 campaign. Senate\n    races are inherently difficult to compare, however, because the states holding elections\n    vary from year to year, and because individual races or candidates can have significant\n    impact on the overall totals. For example, the open seat campaigns in New York and New\n    Jersey in 2000 generated large spending totals that were not matched in the most expensive\n    races in 2002.</p>\n    <p>House candidates raised $539.5 million, nearly unchanged from 2000 totals, and spent\n    $499.7 million, up 1% from the previous cycle. This follows increases of about 30% in\n    House financial activity from 1998 to 2000.</p>\n    <p>The general pattern of financial activity in 2002 campaigns can also be seen in the\n    overall totals for general election winners:</p>\n    <div align=\"center\"><center><table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"9\" width=\"100%\">\n      <caption class=\"bold\">Financial Activity of

contributed $258 million through November 25, representing about 31% of all\n    fundraising. Candidates themselves contributed and loaned a total of $70.3 million to\n    their campaigns which was nearly 9% of receipts. </p>\n    <p>While House campaigns showed little overall change when compared to the 2000 cycle,\n    tables attached to this release reveal substantial shifts in financial activity for\n    different types of candidates in House races. There were slight increases in median\n    financial activity for House incumbents and open-seat candidates during the current\n    campaign, but median receipts and disbursements by House challengers of both parties were\n    lower in dollar terms during the 2002 campaign than in any election since 1992. </p>\n    <p>Median spending by Democratic challengers declined by 65% when compared with 2000 and\n    median spending by Republican challengers fell 19%. In addition, there were fewer\n    incumbents of both parties who won with 55% of the vote or less than in 2000 and no\n    increase in open-seat races with small victory margins in spite of the reapportionment and\n    redistricting efforts that followed the 2000 census.</p>\n    <h2><strong>Tables</strong></h2>\n    <p class=\"small\">[Tables are in EXCEL format which can be viewed using
