This \n        represents an increase of 20% in receipts and 15% is spending over the \n        comparable period in 2002.</p>\n      <p>Senate candidates participating in the 2004 general election raised $327.7 \n        million and spent $278 million during the period from January 1, 2003 \n        through October 13, 2004.&#160; Receipts were 27% higher than 2002, while \n        Senate spending is up by 22%.&#160; Comparisons across election cycles \n        are particularly difficult for Senate races because the states involved \n        vary and also a few campaigns can significantly affect totals. For example, \n        in 2004 there are Senate campaigns in several large states that typically \n        are more expensive. California , New York , and Pennsylvania have incumbents \n        seeking reelection, and there are open seat races in Florida and Illinois \n        . </p>\n      <p>House general election candidate fundraising increased 16% over 2002 \n        levels to a total of $544.8 million.&#160; Spending by these candidates \n        totaled $433.6 million, up 11%. This growth is found mainly among Republican \n        candidates whose fundraising increased by 28% since 2002 with spending \n        up by 21%.&#160; Fundraising by Democratic House candidates, by contrast, \n        increased by 4% while their spending rose only 1%.&#160; Both the number \n        of open seat candidates and their financial activity declined for both \n        parties in 2004 with the smallest number of open seat campaigns since \n        1990. Tables that follow, however, show that median receipts grew in 2004 \n        for all types of House campaigns, though open seat medians are virtually \n        unchanged for both parties.</p>\n      <p>Contributions from individuals totaled $553.2 million and continue to \n        be the largest source of receipts for Congressional candidates, representing \n        63.4% of all fundraising as of October 13. PAC contributions totaled $250.9 \n        million or 28.8%, while candidates themselves contributed or loaned a \n        total of $31.7 million, which was 3.6% of all receipts. Contributions \n        from individuals grew by 34% when compared with the same time period in \n        the 2002 campaign, while PAC contributions increased by 12% and contributions \n        and loans from candidates themselves were 43% lower than 2002 totals. \n      </p>\n      <p>Tables attached to this release offer summary data for Senate and House \n        candidates by political party, as well as by candidate status (incumbent, \n        challenger, or open seat). Also included are rankings of Senate and House \n        candidates for the following categories: receipts, individual contributions, \n        PAC and other committee contributions, contributions and loans from the \n        candidate, disbursements, cash-on-hand, and debts owed. Six-year financial \n        summaries of Senate candidates for 2004, as well as current cycle financial \n        summaries for each House campaign are also attached. </p>\n      <p>This release and the data contained in it are also available on the FEC's \n        web site at <em><u>http://www.fec.gov </u></em><u/>under the Press \n        Office. </p>\n      <p>&#160;</p>\n      <hr/> <p align=\"left\">&#160; </p>\n      <p align=\"center\">Footnotes </p>\n      <p>&#160; </p>\n      <p>&#149;&#160; Figures in the first two tables and the detailed listings \n        of candidates cover from January 1, 2003, or whenever the campaign registered \n        during the year, through October 13, 2004.</p>\n      <p>&#149;&#160; Net receipt and net disbursement figures are total receipts \n        and total disbursements, as reported by the campaigns, minus any money \n        transferred between committees of the same campaign. </p>\n      <p>&#149;&#160; Columns entitled &#147;Contrib from Other Cmte's&#148; are monies \n        contributed to campaigns by PACs and other committees as reported by the \n        campaigns.
