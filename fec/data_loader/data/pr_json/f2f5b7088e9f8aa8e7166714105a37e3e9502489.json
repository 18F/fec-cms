Corporations are permitted to offer affinity programs with political committees so long as the corporation and political committee enter into a commercially reasonable transaction in which the political committee pays the usual and normal charge for any services provided and the amounts contributed to the political committee via rebates or rewards are from funds of the corporation&#8217;s customer and not from those of the corporation.<br/>\n            <br/>\n  In <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">Advisory Opinion Request 2010-07</a>, the Commission discussed two alternative draft responses and then instructed the Office of General Counsel to draft a revised response to reflect the areas of consensus that emerged during the Commission&#8217;s discussion. The requester, a California state ballot measure committee, asked whether and how Members of Congress may solicit donations to it (i) during the period before the measure qualifies for the November 2010 general election ballot, and (ii) during the post-qualification period leading up to the date of the general election. <s/></p>\n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"100%\" valign=\"top\"><p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
