This new feature provides a quick reference for citizens and for the candidates, party committees and political action committees participating in elections.</p>\n        <p>&#8220;The FEC&#8217;s Compliance Map provides a one-stop guide to disclosure schedules for each state,&#8221; said Commission Chairman Matthew S. Petersen. &#8220;It is equally useful for committees taking part in elections and members of the public seeking reliable and easily accessible information on electoral processes.&#8221;</p>\n        <p> The map provides schedules for pre- and post-election reporting, independent expenditures, coordination, federal election activity and electioneering communications. It also provides election dates, as well as contact information for key state offices including those offering information on ballot access and state campaign finance questions.</p>\n        <p> The Compliance Map is part of a comprehensive effort to make the FEC website more user-friendly and intuitive. Questions about the website can be addressed by posting a comment on the FEC&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/blog/\">Disclosure Data blog</a>.<br/>\n        </p>\n        <p align=\"left\"><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
