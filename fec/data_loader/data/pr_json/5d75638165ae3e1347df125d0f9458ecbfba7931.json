In one matter, a campaign committee and its treasurer agreed to pay civil penalties of $99,000. In another matter, the Commission found probable cause to believe a violation occurred but declined to file suit. In addition, the FEC found no reason to believe the law was violated in five instances and closed the file in two other cases.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>Under the law, the FEC must attempt to resolve its enforcement cases, or Matters Under Review (MURs), through a confidential investigative process that may lead to a negotiated conciliation agreement between the Commission and the individual or group.
