This brings to 243 the total number of cases released since the ADR program began October 2, 2000. The program&#8217;s goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement matters, reduce the cost of processing complaints, and enhance overall FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available in the FEC&#8217;s Press and Public Records offices.</p>\n      <p align=\"left\"> For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside the statute of limitations while the case is pending in the ADR Office, and agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if necessary, mediation.</p>\n      <p>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching an expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both satisfying to the respondent(s) and in compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA).&#160; Resolutions reached through direct and, when necessary, mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval. If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved through ADR are not precedential.</p>\n      <p/>\n      <p/>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=278&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">ADR 278 </a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>Dollars for Democrats, Ann Fishman, treasurer </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SOURCE:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>FEC Initiated (RAD)  </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>Failure to report receipts  </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>           \n          </p><p> Respondents acknowledged that the subject receipts were not included in the original 2004 12 Day Pre-General Election Report and once discovered, they amended the report to disclose the additional receipts. Respondents explained that they did not make contributions or expenditures on behalf of candidates for elective Federal office covered by the 12 Day Pre-General Election Report. Given that the Committee did not make contributions or expenditures on behalf of any candidate for Federal office during the reporting period, there was no requirement that the Committee file the 12 Day Pre-General Election Report. However, since the Committee chose to file the report, it would have been preferable if they had included the aforementioned receipts. Given these circumstances, the Commission determined that this matter be dismissed. </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD: </strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at http://www.fec.gov by entering 278 under case number in the Enforcement Query System.&#160; They are also available in the FECs Public Records Office at 999 E St. NW in Washington.</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>2.</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=284&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">ADR 284</a></strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>Idaho Republican Party, Andrew Fales, treasurer </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SOURCE:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>FEC Initiated (Audit) </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>SUBJECT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>Failure to accurately provide contributor information/failure to employ \"best efforts\" in obtaining contributor information </p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"53\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n          <td width=\"203\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT:</strong></p></td>\n          <td width=\"481\" valign=\"top\"><p>$10,000 civil penalty</p>\n          Respondents contend that the turnover in the Committee&#8217;s staff, the irregular employment of professional staff to assist the Committee in complying with the Act&#8217;s reporting requirements and the lack of the appropriate records led to the violations.
