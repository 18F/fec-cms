Since the Administrative Fine Program&#8217;s inception in 2000, the FEC has collected $2,168,904 in civil penalties for 1,619 cases processed under the Program. </p>\n              <p>The Administrative Fine Program has a two-fold purpose: to free critical Commission resources for more important and complex enforcement efforts, and to reduce the number of financial reports filed late or not at all. The program encompasses a range of fines set high enough to discourage committees from considering them an acceptable &#8220;cost of doing business,&#8221; but not so high as to be exorbitant. </p>\n              <p>Fine amounts are based on a formula that includes how late the report was received by the FEC, the amount of financial activity and whether fines were assessed for previous violations. Election sensitive reports (reports and notices filed immediately prior to an election) receive higher penalties. Additional information about the Administrative Fine Program is available on the FEC web site at <a href=\"../../af/af.shtml\">http://www.fec.gov/af/af.shtml</a>.</p>\n              <p>The attached table provides summary information on these 23 cases. Publicly available documents for completed Administrative Fine cases are also available in the Commission&#8217;s Press and Public Records offices.</p>\n              <p>&#160;</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p align=\"left\"><strong>Committees and Administrative Fine Information <a href=\"../press2008/adminfines_mar2008.xls\">[excel]</a> <a href=\"../press2008/adminfines_mar2008.pdf\">[pdf]</a> </strong></p>\n              <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n              <p align=\"center\"/>\n              <p><strong/></p>\n              <p><strong>*Late filers are those committees filing non-election sensitive reports after the due date, but within 30 days of the due date, and/or filing election sensitive reports after the due date, but prior to four days before the election.
