Rainville (VT At Large) and her committee violated the law by failing to register and report in a timely manner. </p>    \n      <p align=\"left\">The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed MUR 5676 due to the fact that the size of the alleged violation by US-Cuba Democracy PAC was small, the debt involved was purportedly treated by the committee's vendor in a commercially reasonable manner and was ultimately repaid by the committee.The Commission also dismissed MUR 5734 because Angie Paccione for Congress (CO 4th District) took immediate action ensuring that alleged personal use of campaign funds never came to fruition.<strong> </strong>This release contains only disposition information.</p>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>1.</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong><a href=\"http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs?SUBMIT=news&amp;CASENUM=5703&amp;CASETYPE=mur\">MUR 5703 </a></strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>RESPONDENTS:</strong></p></td>\n          <td valign=\"top\"><p>(a)&#160;&#160; Martha T.
