Goodman and Vice Chair Ann M. Ravel today hosted a public forum on the challenges faced by political parties engaged in federal campaign finance activity. </p>\n        <p>&#8220;It has been extraordinarily helpful to hear directly from the people whose vital campaign activity is affected by the Commission&#8217;s policies and practices,&#8221; Chairman Goodman said. &#8220;The Commission strives to implement a regulatory process that is fair and protects the First Amendment rights of all citizens.&#160; Nowhere are these principles more important than in the context of local, state, and national political parties, which are the grassroots organizations at the heart of our American democracy.&#8221;</p>\n        <p>Eleven national party committees, 121 state party committees and 264 local party committees are registered with the Commission. Representatives from a number of those parties came to the Commission or joined the Commissioners via audio link to discuss the impact of the Commission&#8217;s operations on local, state and national parties and to put forward suggestions for improving the Commission&#8217;s administration of the law.</p>\n        <p>&#8220;It has been beneficial to hear all the ideas discussed during today&#8217;s forum,&#8221; said Vice Chair Ravel. &#8220;Exchanges such as this one help the Commission to effectively carry out its mission on behalf of the public, and I look forward to continuing to work with Chair Goodman and my other colleagues on initiatives to increase the participation of all Americans in the political process.&#8221;</p>\n        <p>An audio link to the party forum is <a href=\"../../../audio/2014/20140604_FORUM.mp3\">here</a>  (MP3, 60.8 MB).</p>\n        <p>&#160;</p>\n        <p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
