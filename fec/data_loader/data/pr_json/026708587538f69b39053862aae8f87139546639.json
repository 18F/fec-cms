Among the tables attached to this release is a list of the nonconnected PACs with the largest increase in fundraising from 2003 to 2005.</p>\n      <p>Another table shows contributions to candidates broken down by office and party.&#160; Overall increases in contributions ranged from 20% for PAC contributions to Senate Democrats (to a total of $15.2 million) to a 45% increase for House Republican candidates for a 2005 total of $62.2 million.&#160; While contributions to both Democrats and Republicans in both chambers were higher in 2005, growth rates were generally greater for Republican candidates in both the Senate and House of Representatives.&#160; However, contributions by labor committees increased more modestly, with only House Democrats receiving a double digit increase over 2003 totals. </p>\n      <p>PACs ended 2005 with $330.4 million cash-on-hand, 23% more than they had available at the end of 2003.&#160; They reported outstanding debts of $7.4 million, down 12% from 2003.</p>\n      <p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Tables</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Summary of PAC Financial Activity 1993-2005&#160; [<a href=\"pac2005.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n    [<a href=\"pac2005.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">PAC Contributions to Candidates 1993-2005&#160; [<a href=\"contribhistory2005.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n    [<a href=\"contribhistory2005.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Chart - PAC Receipts and Contributions to Candidates by PAC Type&#160;  \n    [<a href=\"paccharts.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Top 50 PACs by Receipts January 1, 2005 - December 31, 2005&#160; \n    [<a href=\"top50rec2005.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"top50rec2005.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Top 50 PACs by Contributions to Candidates January 1, 2005 - \n    December 31, 2005&#160; [<a href=\"top50contrib2005.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"top50contrib2005.pdf\">PDF</a>]</p>\n    <p align=\"left\">Top 50 PACs by Cash on Hand as of December 31, 2005 [<a href=\"../20060308pac/top50cash2005a.xls\">EXCEL</a>] \n    [<a href=\"top50cash2005a.pdf\">PDF</a>]\n    </p><p align=\"left\">Nonconnected PACs with the Largest Increase in Fundraising in 2005 [<a href=\"../20060308pac/noncongrowth2005.xls\">EXCEL</a>] [<a href=\"noncongrowth2005.pdf\">PDF</a>]    \n    </p><p align=\"center\"><br/>\n<br/>\n    ###<br/>\n&#160;</p></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "press2006/20060308pac/20060308pac.html", "date": "03/08/2006", "pdf": null, "title": "PAC Financial Activity Surges in 2005", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries"}
