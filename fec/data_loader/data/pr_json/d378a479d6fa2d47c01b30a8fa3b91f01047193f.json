The Commission concluded that neither the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), nor Commission regulations require the Retiree Support Group of Contra Costa County, California, to submit a proposal to establish a separate segregated fund (SSF) to the organization&#8217;s members for a vote before it can establish the SSF. Under the Act and Commission regulations, an incorporated membership organization may pursue the internal policy of its choice to establish an SSF. The advisory opinion noted that Commission regulations state that each SSF must file a Statement of Organization with the FEC no later than 10 days after the occurrence of certain establishment events if the SSF is to be used wholly or partly for Federal elections.</p>\n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n          <tr>\n            <td width=\"100%\" valign=\"top\"><p><em>The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is an independent regulatory agency that administers and enforces federal campaign finance laws.
