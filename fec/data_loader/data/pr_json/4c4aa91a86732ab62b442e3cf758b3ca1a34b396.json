Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Committee did not itemize contributor information for contributions raised through joint fundraising, over-reported and misreported contributions, under-reported cash-on-hand and improperly reported disbursements to the Internal Revenue Service.&#160; The complaint further alleged that the Friends of John Perzel Committee made excessive contributions to the Gerlach Committee and that Valley Forge Investment Corporation made a prohibited contribution in 2004 that was attributed to Richard Ireland.</p>\n                      <p>The Commission found reason to believe that the Gerlach Committee and Michael DeHaven, in his official capacity as treasurer, violated the act by failing to itemize contributor information in the 2004 Year End Report after receiving funds from a joint fundraising committee, incorrectly reporting the total contributions for the election cycle-to-date in several 2004 and 2005 reports and by misreporting refunded contributions as unitemized contributions received in the 2005 October Quarterly Report.&#160; Alan Randzin was treasurer of the Committee at the time the violations described herein occurred. Michael DeHaven became treasurer of the Committee on November 9, 2005, after the violations described herein occurred and is named herein only in his official capacity.(1) The Commission also found reason to believe that the Committee incorrectly reported the following information: contributions from persons other than a political committee, total election cycle to date contributions for an individual, and cash on hand.&#160; The FEC sent an admonishment letter and took no further action regarding these matters.&#160; The Commission found no reason to believe that the Committee failed to accurately report disbursements to the IRS or taxes withheld from contractors or accepted prohibited corporate contributions.&#160; The FEC dismissed the allegation involving Friends of John Perzel and found no reason to believe Valley Forge Investment, Richard Ireland or Alan Randzin violated the Act.</p></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p/></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                  <td width=\"45\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong/></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"225\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</strong></p></td>\n                  <td width=\"555\" valign=\"top\"><p>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission&#8217;s web site at <a href=\"../..\">http://www.fec.gov</a> by entering 5690 under case numbers in the Enforcement Query System.
