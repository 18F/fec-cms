The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is seeking a renewal of a partial exemption the Commission has granted in the past from certain reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) and Commission regulations. The exemption has allowed the SWP to avoid disclosure of the identities of contributors to the SWP and the identities of recipients of SWP disbursements. The SWP files reports with the Commission containing coded references for itemized contributors and recipients of disbursements, rather than names, addresses and other identifying information. </p>\n        <p>Advisory Opinions and Requests are available through the <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">Advisory Opinions search page</a> in the Law and Regulations section of the Commission website. </p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public three closed cases.

Blunt was a 2010 candidate for Missouri&#8217;s U.S. Senate seat.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission closed the file. A <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocsMUR/13044330706.pdf\">Statement of Reasons</a> was issued by Chair Ellen L. Weintraub and Commissioners Cynthia L. Bauerly and Steven T.

The complaint alleged further that ISPAC failed to include complete disclaimers on the ads in question. Finally, the complaint alleged that ISPAC and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) conspired to evade New Mexico&#8217;s contribution limits.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe ISPAC failed to file complete and timely 48-hour notices because the ads in question did not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a federal candidate and therefore entailed no requirement to disclose the costs of the ads as independent expenditures. The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the allegation that ISPAC failed to provide complete ad disclaimers in light of the fact that the&#160; communications at issue contained sufficient identifying information to prevent the public from being misled as to who authorized and paid for them. The Commission sent a letter reminding ISPAC of the requirements for disclaimers. The Commission found no reason to believe CWA violated the Act in connection with the alleged evasion of New Mexico&#8217;s contribution limits because the Commission has no jurisdiction over state contribution limits.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6611</a> <br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: James R. Baum<br/>\n  RESPONDENT: Friends of Laura Ruderman and Abbot Taylor, in his official capacity as treasurer; Laura Ruderman; Progress for Washington and Jeremy Pemble, in his official capacity as treasurer; and Margaret Rothschild<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Progress for Washington, an independent expenditure-only political committee, (PFW) made and Friends of Laura Ruderman and (FLR) accepted impermissible in-kind contributions by coordinating in connection with advertisements criticizing one of Ruderman&#8217;s opponents. The complaint alleged further that PFW made unlawful, in-kind contributions to Ruderman and FLR using funds raised in unlimited amounts for the purpose of making independent expenditures. Ruderman was a 2012 candidate for Washington&#8217;s 1st Congressional District.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission closed the file.
