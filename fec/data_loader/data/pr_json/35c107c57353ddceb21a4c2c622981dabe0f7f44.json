In\naddition, the</p>\n\n<p>petition recommends that candidates have equal access to debates held before</p>\n\n<p>September 1 without regard to the above requirements.</p>\n\n<p>The petition is available for inspection in the Commission&#146;s Public Records\nOffice. Description and notice of availability of the petition was printed in the Federal\nRegister on June 10, 1999, page 31159.</p>\n\n<p>Extension of the comment period was approved due to public requests.</p>\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n<p align=\"CENTER\"># # # </p>\n</font>\n</body>\n"}
