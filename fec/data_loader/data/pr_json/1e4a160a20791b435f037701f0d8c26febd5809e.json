Webster<br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: Angus King for U.S. Senate Campaign and S. Catherine Longley, in her official capacity as treasurer; Angus King; Americans Elect; and Eliot Cutler<br/>\n          SUBJECT:&#160; The complaint alleged that Americans Elect, a group formed under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, failed to register with and report to the Commission as a political committee because it aired more than $500,000 in television advertisements expressly advocating King&#8217;s election. The complaint alleged further that one of the advertisements at issue was coordinated between Americans Elect and Angus King for U.S. Senate Campaign and Longley, in her official capacity as treasurer (the Committee), because Cutler held positions concurrently with both Americans Elect and the Committee. King was a 2012 candidate for Maine&#8217;s United States Senate seat.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe Americans Elect failed to register and report as a political committee because the available information indicated that the group&#8217;s major purpose was not the nomination and election of particular federal candidates. The Commission also found no reason to believe coordination occurred because the record indicates that the activity at issue did not satisfy the conduct prong of the coordination regulations.</p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FINES</strong></p>\n          <p><strong/></p>\n          <p>The Commission made public one campaign finance enforcement matter that was resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program, as follows.
