This brings to 152 \n        the total number of cases released since the ADR program began October \n        2, 2000 . The program's goal is to expedite resolution of some enforcement \n        matters, reduce the cost of processing complaints, and enhance overall \n        FEC enforcement. Closed ADR negotiated settlement summaries are available \n        in the FEC's Press and Public Records offices. </span></p>\n      <p align=\"left\"> <span>For a case to be considered for ADR treatment, a respondent \n        must express willingness to engage in the ADR process, agree to set aside \n        the statute of limitations while the case is pending in the ADR Office, \n        and agree to participate in bilateral negotiations and, if necessary, \n        mediation.</span></p>\n      <p align=\"left\"><span>Bilateral negotiations through ADR are oriented toward reaching \n        an expedient resolution with a mutually agreeable settlement that is both \n        satisfying to the respondent(s) and in compliance with the Federal Election \n        Campaign Act (FECA). Resolutions reached through direct and, when necessary, \n        mediated negotiations are submitted to the Commissioners for final approval. \n        If a resolution is not reached in bilateral negotiation, the case proceeds \n        by mutual agreement to mediation. It should be noted that cases resolved \n        through ADR are not precedential.</span></p>\n      <p align=\"RIGHT\"/>\n      <table cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"100%\" bordercolor=\"#111111\">\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\"><b>1.</b></td>\n          <td width=\"29%\"><b>ADR 162 </b></td>\n          <td width=\"65%\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"65%\">&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\"><b>RESPONDENTS:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"65%\"> Carol Moseley Braun for President, Moti Agarwal, treasurer  </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\"><b>SOURCE:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"65%\"> MUR 5412: Vasyl Markus  </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\"><b>SUBJECT:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"65%\"> Failure to disclose outstanding debt  </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"29%\"><b>NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"65%\"><p> Respondents contend there is a bona fide disagreement whether there is a debt owed to complainant particularly given the lack of evidence to support the aforementioned claim. Nevertheless, there is precedent regarding Respondents&#8217; obligation to report a claim that is in dispute. Respondents agree that if the complainant provides sufficient evidence to support his claim, they are prepared to amend the reports filed with the Commission listing the claim as a bona fide debt. In the interim, Respondents agree to comply with the regulations and file an amended 2003 Year End Report with the Commission listing the amount in dispute. Respondents agree to note the amount of disputed debts on the next appropriate monthly report, and will continue to list the disputed debt on subsequent reports until the debt is resolved or the Committee is terminated.\n\n</p></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td>2.</td>\n          <td><b>ADR 182 </b></td>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td>&#160;</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>RESPONDENTS:</b></td>\n          <td><p>(a) U.
