Deutsch, Assistant General \n        Counsel, and may be submitted in either electronic or written form. Electronic \n        mail comments are encouraged to ensure timely receipt, and should be sent \n        to <a href=\"mailto:choiceprovision@fec.gov\">choiceprovision@fec.gov</a>.&#160; \n        They must include the full name, electronic mail address, and postal service \n        address of the commenter. Any attachments must be in the Adobe Acrobat \n        (.pdf) or Microsoft Word (.doc) format.&#160; Faxed comments should be \n        sent to (202) 219-3923 with printed copy follow-up to ensure legibility.&#160; \n        Written comments should be sent to the Federal Election Commission, 999 \n        E Street, NW, Washington DC 20463.</p>\n      <p align=\"CENTER\">###</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td width=\"100%\">&#160; </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n", "href": "press2004/20040706rules.html", "date": "07/06/2004", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Seeks Comment on Proposed Rules on Party Committee Independent Expenditures and Coordinated Party Expenditures", "category": "Rulemakings"}
