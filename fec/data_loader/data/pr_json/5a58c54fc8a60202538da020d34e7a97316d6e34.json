Democratic <u><b>federal</b></u>\naccounts reported raising $83.8  million, and spending of $79.7\nmillion after all transfers were removed.  Republican receipts\nreflect a drop of just over 17% in receipts when compared to the\nsame period in 1995-96, a  presidential cycle, while Democratic\nreceipts reflect a drop of over 11%.  By contrast, Republican\nreceipts decreased less than 1% between '92 and '94 (15-month\nperiods), while Democratic receipts increased more than 34%.\n</p><p>\nIndividuals accounted for 92% of Republican party receipts, contributing\n$135.8 million.  Democratic party committees received 76% of their\nfunds from individuals, or $63.3 million.  Democrats relied more\nheavily on PAC contributions, receiving $10.3 million (12%) versus\nRepublican PAC receipts of $6.3 million (4%).\n</p><p>\nRepublicans reported cash on hand of $14.8 million and debts of\n$8 million, while Democrats reported cash on hand of $6.7 million\nand debts of $11.7 million. \n</p><p>\nDemocratic party committees contributed $936,205 directly to federal\ncandidates and spent $2.9 million  in coordinated party expenditures\non behalf of candidates for the first 15 months of the 1997-98\ncycle.  Republican party committees contributed $810,552 to federal\ncandidates and spent $286,600 in coordinated expenditures during\nthe same period.  \n</p><p>\nRepublicans also outraised the Democrats in nonfederal, or \"soft\nmoney,\"<b>* </b>activity.  Republican <u><b>nonfederal</b></u>\naccounts collected $58.4 million,  a 31% increase over the same\nperiod in the previous cycle.  Democratic <u><b>nonfederal</b></u>\naccounts reported raising $42.1 million, a 6% increase over the\nsame period in the 1995-96 cycle. \n</p><p>\nCharts attached to this release provide summary data for the financial\nactivities of the Republican and Democratic party committees during\nthe first 15 months of the 1997-98 election cycle compared to\nthe same period in five previous election cycles.  Comparable\ndata on nonfederal party activity is available only back to the\n1991-92 cycle.  The FEC began requiring national party committees\nto disclose their nonfederal accounts in January 1991. \n</p><p>\n<b>*</b>\"Soft money\" describes funds raised outside\nthe limitations and prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign\nAct.  Soft money must be deposited in separate nonfederal accounts\nand cannot be used in connection with federal elections.  To enhance\npublic disclosure, the FEC requires national political party committees\nto report the sources of receipts to all nonfederal accounts.\n <br/>\n</p><ul>\n<li><a href=\"/press/dfed15.htm\">Democratic Federal Financial Activity</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"/press/rfed15.htm\">Republican Federal Financial Activity</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"/press/dsoft15.htm\">Democratic Non Federal Activity</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"/press/rsoft15.htm\">Republican Non Federal Activity</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"/press/allsft15.htm\">Non Federal Party Activity Since 1991-92</a>\n\n\n</li></ul></body>", "href": "pty1598.htm", "date": "06/08/1998", "pdf": null, "title": "FEC Releases 15-Month Summary on Political Party Finances", "category": "Campaign Finance Data Summaries"}
