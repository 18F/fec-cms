Adjustments are announced after the Department of Labor determines the inflation rate for the previous election year (in this case 2010). The new limit on contributions from individuals to candidates is effective retroactively to the day after the last general election (i.e., Nov. 3, 2010).The other new limits are effective retroactively to Jan. 1, 2011.</p>\n        <p>The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA) added the requirement that certain political committees disclose contributions bundled by lobbyists/registrants and lobbyist/registrant political action committees once the contributions exceed a specified threshold amount. This amount, adjusted annually for inflation, is $16,200 for calendar year 2011.</p>\n        <p>Under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), the Commission must adjust coordinated party expenditure limits annually to account for inflation. This applies to coordinated expenditures by national party committees and state party committees or their subordinate committees in connection with the general election campaign of candidates for federal office. The coordinated party expenditure limits that apply to any general elections held in 2011 can be found in this <a href=\"../info/charts_441ad_2011.shtml\">chart</a> on the FEC website. </p>\n        <p>-------------------------</p>\n        <p><em>* These contribution limits are increased for inflation in odd-numbered years. </em></p>\n        <p><em> (1) A contribution earmarked for a candidate through a political committee counts against the original contributor&#8217;s limit for that candidate.
