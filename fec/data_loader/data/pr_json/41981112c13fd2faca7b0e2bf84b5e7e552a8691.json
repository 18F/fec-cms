Semi-annual reporting is no longer an \n    option for Congressional committees.</p>\n    <p>Year End reports are due on January 31. Electronically filed reports must \n    be received by midnight, Eastern time, on the filing date. Senate campaigns \n    file their reports with the Secretary of the Senate, who then forwards the \n    reports to the FEC. All other committees file their reports with the FEC.</p>\n    <p/>\n    <p>Digital images of campaign finance reports are now available on the FEC \n    Website, www.fec.gov. All reports filed by PACs, political parties, \n    Presidential, Senate, and House campaigns are available for viewing on the \n    Web within 48 hours of the reports being received by the FEC. </p>\n    <p/>\n    <p>The Public Records Office accepts most major credit cards as method of \n    payment for copying documents and deposits for Public Records accounts. The \n    telephone number for the Public Records Office is (202) 694-1120, or \n    toll-free (800) 424-9530 (option #3).
