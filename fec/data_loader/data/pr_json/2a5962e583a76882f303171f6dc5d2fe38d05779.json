Non-connected PACs (those which are not connected to\nor sponsored by a corporation or labor organization, and which\nare not related to a candidate's campaign or to a political party\norganization) must register within 10 days after certain\nfinancial activity exceeds $1,000 during a calendar year. </font></p>\n\n<p><font face=\"Book Antiqua\">Registration does not necessarily\nimply financial activity. Many PACs report making no\ncontributions to candidates or independent expenditures on behalf\nof or against candidates.
