On July 27, the plaintiff filed an <a href=\"../../law/litigation/freespeech_fs_amend_complaint.pdf\">Amended Complaint</a> in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"../../law/litigation/vroom.shtml\"><strong><em>Vroom v.

Van Hollen challenges as contrary to the law the Commission&#8217;s regulation concerning disclosure for electioneering communications, 11 C.F.R. 104.20(c)(9).</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>RULEMAKING AND AGENCY PROCEDURES<br/>\n              <br/>\n  Guidance for Persons Making Disbursements for Electioneering Communications</strong>. On July 27, the Commission issued a <a href=\"20120727_VanHollen_v_FEC.shtml\">public statement</a> outlining how the Commission will comply with the opinion and order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in <a href=\"../../law/litigation/van_hollen.shtml\"><em>Van Hollen v. FEC</em></a> (Civ. No. 11-0766). The court found that the Commission regulation at 11 CFR 104.20(c)(9) is invalid and vacated it. That regulation, which was adopted in 2007 and governed electioneering communications by corporations and labor organizations, required that their donors be disclosed only if their donations were &#8220;made for the purpose of furthering electioneering communications.&#8221;&#160; The court reinstated the Commission&#8217;s prior regulation at 104.20(c). The Commission&#8217;s public statement offers guidance to persons reporting electioneering communications pending the appeal of <em>Van Hollen v. FEC</em> by defendant-intervenors.<strong><br/>\n  <br/>\n  ELECTIONEERING COMMUNICATION REPORTING PERIODS<br/>\n  <br/>\n  </strong>The Commission learned today that its website reflected incorrect dates for the Electioneering Communication (EC) reporting periods for the national nominating conventions. The correct EC period for the Republican national nominating convention begins on July 28 and the EC period for the Democratic national nominating convention begins on August 4. See 11 CFR 100.29(b)(3)(ii)(B). The website had mistakenly identified those starting dates as July 31 and August 7, respectively. The website has been <a href=\"../../info/charts_ec_dates_2012.shtml\">corrected</a>. <br/>\n  <br/>\n  The Commission regrets the error. The Commission will exercise its prosecutorial discretion and will not take enforcement action with respect to communications disbursements made in reasonable reliance on the erroneous information on the website in connection with EC reporting.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>OUTREACH</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p>On July 25, Vice Chair Ellen L.
