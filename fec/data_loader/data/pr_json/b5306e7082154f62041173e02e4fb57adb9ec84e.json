The FEC found probable \n              cause to believe that CDP and its federal and non-federal committees \n              used impermissible funds to finance express advocacy communications, \n              misreporting the disbursements for the communications as allocable \n              generic voter activity instead of independent expenditures, and \n              for failing to include proper disclaimers in the communications. \n              The Commission then rejected the CDP counter offer in conciliation \n              and authorized a law suit. </p>\n            The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California ordered \n            the defendants to pay a $30,000 civil penalty. The Court found that \n            the defendants violated the Act by using non-federal funds to pay \n            for mass mailings and radio advertisements that constituted express \n            advocacy of a clearly identified federal candidate; failure to include \n            the required disclaimers; failure to report the ads as independent \n            expenditures and enjoined them from further similar violations of \n            the FECA. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td width=\"6%\">&#160;</td>\n          <td width=\"26%\"><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td width=\"68%\">Documents from these matters are available from the \n            Commission's web site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering \n            4788 under case number.

Muller).</p>\n            <p>In MUR 4935 the complaint alleged the Dear for Congress Committee \n              (1998 election cycle) accepted excessive contributions and prohibited \n              corporate contributions, filed an incorrect disclosure report and \n              failed to timely file disclosure reports. The complaint also alleged \n              that Friends of Noach Dear '93, a state committee, funded a poll \n              which had the purpose of measuring whether Mr. Dear should become \n              a candidate in the 2000 election for a federal election. </p>\n            <p>MUR 5057 was generated from a Commission audit of the Committee's \n              activities during the 1998 election cycle. The audit found that \n              the committee accepted excessive contributions and did not disclose \n              as debts those excessive contributions which it had not been able \n              to refund, accepted contributions in the name of another, and the \n              committee's failure to file required 48-hour reports and timely \n              file 48-hour reports. The FEC found probable cause to believe that \n              the committee received contributions in the name of another, excessive \n              contributions and prohibited contributions, failed to timely file \n              disclosure reports, improperly reported refunds and failed to report \n              debts, failed to file 48-hour reports and timely file 48-hour reports \n              and failed to report a contribution. The Commission not being able \n              to conciliate with the respondents filed a law suit. </p>\n            The parties, solely for the purpose of settling this case, stipulated \n            that the court could enter a consent judgment, with the defendants \n            neither admitting nor denying the findings included in the judgment. \n            The U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York provided \n            declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief in favor of the Commission. \n            The Court found that the defendants violated the Act by receiving \n            contributions in the name of another, excessive contributions and \n            corporate contributions, failing to timely file disclosure reports, \n            improperly reporting refunds and failing to report debts, failing \n            to file 48-hour reports and timely filing of 48-hour reports and failing \n            to report a contribution. The Court ordered Dear for Congress, Dear \n            2000 and Friends of Noach Dear to pay to the Commission all funds \n            remaining in their accounts as of the date that the parties entered \n            into the agreement, Dear for Congress and Dear 2000 will terminate \n            as a federally registered committee, and Abraham Roth, as treasurer, \n            to pay $45,000 civil penalty to the FEC. </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr> \n          <td>&#160;</td>\n          <td><b>DOCUMENTS ON PUBLIC RECORD:</b></td>\n          <td>Documents from this matter are available from the Commission's web \n            site at http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqs/searcheqs by entering 4935 under \n            case number.
