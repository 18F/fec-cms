Club for Growth also asks whether the planned political committee may solicit donations that are earmarked for specific independent expenditures. Finally, Club for Growth asks whether the Commission&#8217;s analysis would change if the planned political committee were to pay for its own establishment, administrative, and solicitation expenses rather than have those expenses paid for with Club for Growth&#8217;s general treasury funds. The Commission must issue a response no later than 60 days after receipt of the complete request, or by July 20.<br/>\n            <br/>\n  Advisory Opinions and Requests are available<a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=pending\"> here</a>. </p>\n        <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public one closed case this week.
