On September 17, the Commission held a forum to seek broad public input for its effort to improve access to campaign finance data and information through a redesign of the FEC.gov website. The Commission launched its website improvement initiative earlier this year in partnership with 18F, a digital services delivery team in the General Services Administration (GSA). The Commission and 18F welcome suggestions for improving the website.

The Commission concluded further that use of the box under the circumstances described in the request would not subject the fundraising activity at issue to the Commission&#8217;s joint fundraising rules.</p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><u>Drafts</u></p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">AOR 2014-11 (Health Care Service Corporation Employees' PAC)</a>. &#160;On September 17, the Commission made public a <a href=\"../../../agenda/2014/documents/mtgdoc_14-46.pdf\">draft advisory opinion</a> in response to a request from Health Care Service Corporation Employees' PAC.
