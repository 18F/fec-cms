On November 22, the Commission approved Advisory Opinion 2010-24. Since more than 25 percent of the committee&#8217;s Voter Registration Coordinator&#8217;s activities recruiting, training, and supervising contractors hired by the Committee during the applicable Federal election activity (\"FEA\") time periods are Type I FEA (voter registration activity) under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act) and Commission regulations, the Commission concluded that the Voter Registration Coordinator must be paid exclusively from the Committee's federal account within those periods. The Commission was unable to reach a decision on whether the Executive Director's supervision of the Voter Registration Coordinator constitutes voter registration activity. </p>\n        <p>Advisory Opinions and Requests are available <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=pending\">here</a>.</p>\n        <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT </strong></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public one closed case. </p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6301</a> &#8211; California Republican Party/ V8.
