The Commission could not approve a response by the required four affirmative votes concerning the remaining advertisements and donation requests, or concerning NDC's other questions. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><u>Advisory Opinions Considered </u></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\"><strong>AOR 2012-29 (Hawaiian Airlines, Inc.)</strong></a>.
