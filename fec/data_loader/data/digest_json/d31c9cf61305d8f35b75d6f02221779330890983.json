Czarnecki, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Prosperity for Michigan, an independent expenditure-only political committee, and Satterlee, in her official capacity as treasurer and in &#160;her personal capacity, knowingly and willfully violated the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) by intentionally withholding disclosure of contributors to shield the contributors&#8217; identities. The complaint alleged further that Prosperity for Michigan and Satterlee failed to disclose their activities in a timely manner by filing a 48-hour independent expenditure report instead of a 24-hour report, and that they did not make best efforts to include employer and occupation information for seven of nine individual contributors disclosed in an amended quarterly report. Finally, the complaint alleged that Prosperity for Michigan and Satterlee may have coordinated ads with, and thus made an unreported in-kind contribution to, The American Way&#8212;Durant 2012 and Czarnecki, in his official capacity as treasurer (the Durant Committee). Clark Durant was a 2012 primary candidate for Michigan&#8217;s United States Senate seat.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission found reason to believe Prosperity for Michigan and Satterlee failed to disclose receipts and entered into a conciliation agreement providing for Prosperity for Michigan to pay a civil penalty of $2,100.&#160; The Commission found no reason to believe Prosperity for Michigan failed to file its independent expenditure report in a timely manner and exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the best efforts allegation. The Commission further exercised its prosecutorial discretional and dismissed the allegation that Prosperity for Michigan made, and the Durant Committee accepted, an excessive contribution in the form a coordinated communication.&#160; Finally, the Commission found no reason to believe that Satterlee knowingly and willfully violated the reporting provisions of the Act.</p>\n          <p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FINES</strong></p>\n          <p>The Commission made public four campaign finance enforcement matters that were resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program, as follows.
