Feinstein for Senate (the Committee) asked whether contributors whose funds were embezzled by Committee treasurer Kinde Durkee may make replacement contributions. On May 15, the Commission concluded that if a contributor&#8217;s previous contribution was either deposited into one of the Committee&#8217;s accounts, cashed, or otherwise used by the Committee, that contribution counts against the contributor&#8217;s per-election limit to the Committee and must be added to any new contributions in determining whether the contribution limits have been met. On the other hand, the Commission also concluded that, if an attempted contribution was never deposited or cashed, the attempted contribution does not count against the person&#8217;s per-election limit to the Committee, and the Committee may accept funds from that contributor in place of his or her original attempted contribution. The Commission could not approve a response by the required four affirmative votes as to the appropriate treatment of a contribution from a person whose prior intended contribution was deposited into an account other than one of the Committee&#8217;s accounts and not used by the Committee.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><u>Comments Received</u></p>\n        <p><u/></p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1206315.pdf\"><strong>AOR 2012-17 (Red Blue T LLC, ArmourMedia, Inc., and m-Qube, Inc.)</strong></a>.
