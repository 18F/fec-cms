Hebert, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Charles Boustany Jr. M.D. for Congress and Hebert, in his official capacity as treasurer (the Committee), distributed a mailer that failed to include a disclaimer. Boustany was a 2012 candidate for Louisiana&#8217;s 3rd Congressional District.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the matter in light of the fact that the exact scope and cost of the mailer at issue is unknown.</p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6782</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: Justin Meeks<br/>\n          RESPONDENT: Mark Pryor for U.S. Senate and Bob Edwards, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Mark Pryor for U.S. Senate and Edwards, in his official capacity as treasurer (the Committee), included in television ads an image of Pryor that was not large enough to identify him clearly as the candidate approving the ad. Pryor is a 2014 candidate for Arkansas&#8217;s United States Senate seat.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the matter in light of the fact that (1) the original ads appear to have contained sufficient information to clearly identify who paid for the communications, as well as an apparently adequate spoken message of approval by the candidate, and (2) the Committee took immediate action to remedy any alleged disclaimer violation by increasing the candidate&#8217;s photo to a full screen view on new ads.</p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6578</a> &#8211; Doug LaMalfa Committee and David Bauer, in his official capacity as treasurer; Doug LaMalfa; Mark Spannagel; and www.sam4congress.com.
