FEC</a>.</em> On February 10, the Commission filed its <a href=\"../../law/litigation/rnc_fec_supp_brief_cu.pdf\">Supplemental Brief</a> in <em>Republican National Committee v. FEC</em> in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The RNC complaint challenges the constitutionality of the <a href=\"../../pages/bcra/bcra_update.shtml\">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act&#8217;s</a> limits on the use of nonfederal funds by political party committees. The Republican National Committee alleges that the nonfederal fund provisions as applied to their intended activities are overly broad and unconstitutional under the First Amendment guarantees of free speech and association, and are outside of Congress&#8217;s authority to regulate elections. The Commission contends that those provisions are constitutional contribution limits for the reason that they prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>RULEMAKING AND AGENCY PROCEDURES</strong></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>On February 10, the Commission published a <a href=\"../../pdf/nprm/coord_commun/2009/notice2010-01.pdf\">Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Coordinated Communications</a> (SNPRM) in the Federal Register. The SNPRM supplemented a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on <a href=\"../../agenda/2009/mtgdoc0968.pdf\">Coordinated Communications</a>, which was published in the Federal Register on October 21, 2009, presenting possible alternatives to the regulations that govern communications made in coordination with federal candidates, their authorized committees or political parties but paid for by other persons. The NPRM also proposes to define &#8220;promote, support, attack, or oppose.&#8221; The Commission will hold a hearing on March 2 and 3, 2010. Comments are due on February 24. </p>\n        <p><strong>PUBLIC DISCLOSURE</strong></p>\n        <p>The Commission has posted an updated version of &#8220;<a href=\"../../pubrec/pacronyms/Pacronyms.pdf\">PACRONYMS</a>,&#8221; its unofficial, alphabetical list of acronyms, abbreviations, initials, and common names of federal Political Action Committees (PACs).
