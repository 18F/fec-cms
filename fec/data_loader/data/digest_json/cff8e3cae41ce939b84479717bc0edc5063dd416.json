The Committee requests an advisory opinion on whether the Committee may pay three charities the market value of assets including computers, office equipment and supplies that used to belong to a since-terminated state committee and were left in the care of the state committee&#8217;s former landlord. The payment to charities would be in lieu of a straight sale of the assets from the state committee to the federal committee. The Commission must issue a response no later than 60 days after receipt of the complete request, that is, by November 2.</p>\n              <p>                <u>Extension of Time Received</u><strong> </strong></p>\n              <p><strong>AOR 2009-13 (Black Rock Group).</strong> On August 31, the Commission received an Extension of Time regarding Advisory Opinion Request 2009-13 (Black Rock Group) until September 28.
