The Commission approved part of one finding concerning non-allocable federal activities, specifically that payments for certain automated phone banks and customized giveaways are non-allocable federal election activities.&#160; The Commission did not approve the proposed finding with respect to whether costs associated with polling and with campaign rallies constituted non-allocable federal election activities. The Commission approved another finding that certain itemized disbursements failed to include adequate payee address information on disclosure reports to the Commission. The Commission will issue its final audit report the <a href=\"../../agenda/2010/mtgdoc1018.pdf\">Tennessee Democratic Party</a> at a later date.&#160; </p>\n        <p><a href=\"../../agenda/2010/mtgdoc1019.pdf\">Friends for Menor</a>.

Federal Election Commission</a>. On April 26, the United States Supreme Court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for further consideration in light of <em><a href=\"../../law/litigation_CCA_C.shtml#citizensunited\">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a></em>, 558 U.S. ___ (2010), and the Solicitor General's suggestion of mootness.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"../../law/litigation/cao.shtml\"><em>Cao v. FEC.</em></a> On April 26, the Commission filed a <a href=\"../../law/litigation/cao_ac_fec_surreply.pdf\">Sur-Reply</a> in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of coordinated expenditure limits, both under the party expenditure provision in 2 U.S.C. 441a(d) and the $5,000 limit on party contributions to candidates in 2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(2)(A). </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><em><a href=\"../../law/litigation/schonberg.shtml\">Schonberg v. FEC</a></em>. On April 26, the Commission filed an Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Ocala Division. In this case, plaintiffs filed a complaint against the FEC and certain Members of Congress and also requested an emergency injunction and an emergency three-judge court. The plaintiffs alleged that portions of the Federal Election Campaign Act that permit Members of Congress to lead campaign committees are unconstitutional because they violate the Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution, which states that Members of Congress cannot hold other federal offices while in Congress. <br/>\n        </p>\n        <p><strong>RULEMAKING AND AGENCY PROCEDURES</strong><br/>\n            <br/>\n  The Commission approved <a href=\"../../agenda/2010/mtgdoc1022.pdf\">Final Rules and Explanation and Justification</a> on participation by federal candidates and officeholders at non-federal fundraising events. The final rules permit a federal candidate or officeholder to attend, speak at, and appear as featured guests at non-federal fundraising events so long as the federal candidate or officeholder does not solicit funds outside the amount limitations and source prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act).&#160;&#160; Federal candidates and officeholders may also appear in pre-event publicity for a non-federal fundraising event so long as the federal candidate or officeholder is not personally soliciting funds outside the amount limitations and source prohibitions of the Act.&#160; These final rules were promulgated in response to the decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <a href=\"../../law/litigation_CCA_S.shtml_06\"><em>Shays v. FEC</em></a>, 528 F.3d 914 (D.C.
