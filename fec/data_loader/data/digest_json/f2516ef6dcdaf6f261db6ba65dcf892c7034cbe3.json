On April 25, the Commission granted renewal of the partial reporting exemption sought by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) until December 31, 2016. This partial reporting exemption allows the SWP to file reports with the Commission containing coded references for itemized contributors and recipients of disbursements, rather than names, addresses and other identifying information.

Weintraub issued a&#160;<a href=\"../../members/weintraub/statements/AO_2012-38_SWP_ELW_Concurring_Statement.pdf\">Concurring Statement</a>.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?AONUMBER=2013-02\">AO 2013-02 (Dan Winslow)</a>. On April 25, the Commission concluded that the Defense of Marriage Act precludes the Commission from interpreting 11 C.F.R. 110.1(i) to include contributions from same-sex couples who are married under state law. The Commission noted, however, that same-sex couples (whether married under state law or not) who are joint account holders may make contributions from their joint accounts under 11 C.F.R. 110.1(k). Dan Winslow is a candidate for Senate in the April 30 Massachusetts special election.

The Commission also solicits comments on whether to revise a variety of regulations to address electronic transactions, including those made by debit cards, credit cards, gift cards, Internet-based payment processing, online banking, and text message.
