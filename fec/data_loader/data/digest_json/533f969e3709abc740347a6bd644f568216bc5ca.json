Woodworth, a University professor, was a 2012 candidate for Illinois&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe the University made or the Committee accepted a prohibited contribution because the available information shows that (1) the University did not grant any college credit for students who gathered signatures for Woodworth to qualify for ballot access, and (2) the sole student who sought a college credit for an uncompensated campaign internship received such credit pursuant to an academic program conducted in a nonpartisan manner that was consistent with accepted accreditation standards generally applicable to institutions of higher education.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>LITIGATION</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><a href=\"../../law/litigation/McCutcheon.shtml\"><em>McCutcheon, et al. v.
