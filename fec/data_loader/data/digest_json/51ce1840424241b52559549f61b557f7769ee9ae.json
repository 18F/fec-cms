FEC and U.S. Department of Justice</a>.</em> The Real Truth About Obama (RTAO), a nonprofit corporation that filed for status under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, had sought the injunction to enjoin the FEC and the Department of Justice from enforcing three provisions of FEC regulations and the agency&#8217;s \"enforcement policy,\" which it alleges are unconstitutional. RTAO further alleges that the provisions in question exceed the FEC&#8217;s statutory authority and have a chilling effect on the plaintiff&#8217;s speech.<br/>\n              </p>\n              <p>On July 31, the Commission filed a Motion to Dismiss in <em>Utility Workers Union of America, Local 369, AFL-CIO v. FEC</em>. Local 369 petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the Commission&#8217;s dismissal of the union&#8217;s administrative complaint against the Covanta Energy Corporation. The complaint alleged that Covanta solicited contributions for its federal PAC from employees outside its restricted class. The Commission found no reason to believe Covanta violated the Act. </p>\n              <p>&#160;</p>\n              <p><strong>OUTREACH</strong></p>\n              <p>On August 5-6, in Kansas City, MO, the FEC conducted informal briefings for PACs, party committees and candidate committees on areas of the law specific to their needs.&#160; The event was part of the Federal Election Commission&#8217;s <a href=\"../../info/outreach.shtml#state\">State Outreach Program</a>.&#160; </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>On August 3, the Commission added an <a href=\"../../info/elearning.shtml\">E-Learning section</a> to its website and launched a YouTube channel, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/FECTube\">http://www.youtube.com/FECTube</a>.
