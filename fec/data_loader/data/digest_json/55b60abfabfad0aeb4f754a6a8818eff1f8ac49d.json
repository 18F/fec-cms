FEC</em></a> (consolidated with <a href=\"../../law/litigation/speechnow.shtml\"><em>SpeechNow.org v. FEC</em></a>). On December 15, the Commission filed its <a href=\"../../law/litigation/keating_ac_fec_brief.pdf\">merits brief</a> in this <em>en banc</em> case before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Plaintiffs &#8212; including David Keating and, in the consolidated case, SpeechNow.org &#8212; have challenged the constitutionality of contribution limits, reporting requirements, and political committee registration requirements as applied to its proposed activities. Oral argument is scheduled for January 27, 2010.<br/>\n                  <br/>\n                  <em><a href=\"../../law/litigation/schonberg.shtml#dc\">Schonberg v. FEC</a></em>. On December 14, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida denied the plaintiffs' emergency motion to withdraw the December 3 order that denied the plaintiffs' initial motion for emergency relief. Later on December 14, the plaintiffs filed a renewed emergency motion to withdraw the prior order, and the court denied that motion. The plaintiffs allege that portions of the Act that permit Members of Congress to lead campaign committees are unconstitutional because they violate the Emoluments Clause, which states that Members cannot hold other federal offices while in Congress. </p>\n              <p><br/>\n                <strong>RULEMAKING AND AGENCY PROCEDURES</strong></p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>On December 14, the Commission published a <a href=\"../../law/cfr/ej_compilation/2009/notice_2009-28.pdf\">Statement of Policy regarding the placement of First General Counsel&#8217;s Reports on the Public Record</a> in the Federal Register. </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>On December 16, the Commission held a <a href=\"../../pages/hearings/shaysfea09hearing.shtml\">public hearing on its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</a> concerning the definition of Federal Election Activity, part of the implementation of the Appeals Court decision in <em>Shays v.
