Allegretti was a 2010 primary candidate in New York&#8217;s 13th Congressional District.<br/>\n        DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the matter because of the limited scope of the alleged violation and the prompt remedial action taken, and in furtherance of the Commission&#8217;s priorities relative to other pending enforcement matters. The Commission sent a letter reminding Allegretti for Congress and Gravino, in his official capacity as treasurer, about the use of appropriate disclaimers on public communications paid for by political committees.</p>\n        <p>For information regarding each of the above matters, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.</p>\n        <p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FINES</strong> </p>\n        <p>The Commission made public one campaign finance enforcement matter that was resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program. </p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">AF 2152</a> &#8211; Friends of Elliot Richardson and Sherri N.
