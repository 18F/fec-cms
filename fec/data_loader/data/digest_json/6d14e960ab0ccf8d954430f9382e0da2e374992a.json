FEC</a> (Civ. No. 11- 259(RMC))</em>. On January 31, Retired Admiral James Carey, Kelly S. Eustis, and the National Defense Political Action Committee (Plaintiffs) filed a <a href=\"../../law/litigation/carey_carey_complaint.pdf\">complaint</a> in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a declaratory judgment that the contribution limits applicable to political committees in 2 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 441a (a)(1)(C) and 441a(a)(3) violate the First Amendment.&#160; Plaintiffs argue that these laws impermissibly prohibit non-connected political committees from soliciting and accepting unlimited contributions to one bank account designated for independent expenditures, while maintaining a second, separate bank account designated for source- and amount-limited contributions to candidates and their authorized political committees. The complaint also seeks injunctive relief enjoining the Commission from enforcing the above-mentioned provisions as applied to Plaintiffs.&#160; The Complaint was filed concurrently with a <a href=\"../../law/litigation/carey_carey_mot_pre_inj.pdf\">Motion for Preliminary Injunction</a>. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>PUBLIC DISCLOSURE</strong></p>\n        <p>On February 3, the Commission made public the <a href=\"../../pages/brochures/contrib.shtml#Chart\">2011-2012 Price Index Adjustments for Contribution and Expenditure Limitations and Lobbyist Bundling Disclosure</a> on the FEC website.
