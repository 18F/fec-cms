The Commission will accept written comments on the request during the 10-day period following publication of the request (no later than January 7, 2013) and shall issue a response no later than 60 days after receipt of the complete request, specifically by February 12, 2013.</p>\n        <p><strong>  ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public one closed case.

Haney was a 2012 candidate for Colorado&#8217;s 6th Congressional District.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the allegation that Haney and the Committee failed to timely register with the Commission in light of the fact that (1) the Commission is not aware of any statement indicating that Haney was a candidate early enough that his principal campaign committee was required to file a disclosure report prior to the 2011 Year-End Report and (2) the Committee filed its initial disclosure report in a timely manner. The Commission found no reason to believe the Committee filed untimely disclosure reports because the Committee filed the 2011 Year-End Report in a timely manner.</p>\n        <p><strong>  LITIGATION</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><em><a href=\"../../law/litigation/Miller.shtml\">Miller v.
