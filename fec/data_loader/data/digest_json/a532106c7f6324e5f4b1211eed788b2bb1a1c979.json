The Commission concluded that proposed payments by the State Party for campaign materials to be used in connection with volunteer activities on behalf of a Federal candidate before the Nevada 2010 primary election would be exempt from the definitions of &#8220;contribution&#8221; and &#8220;expenditure&#8221; if the candidate is the State Party&#8217;s presumptive nominee. Candidate filing closes on March 12, 2010.&#160; If a Candidate is unopposed after that date he is the presumptive nominee. Only volunteer activities which take place after that date qualify for the exemption.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>Advisory Opinions, Requests, Comments and Extensions are available <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=ao&amp;AO=2932&amp;START=1064308.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public five closed cases this week.
