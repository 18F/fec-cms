The Commission decided to take no further action in the matter in light of the fact that it was unable to identify the individual or individuals responsible for Victory Ohio SuperPAC and in consideration of Commission priorities.</p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6653</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: Debora Stalego<br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: GOTTA VOTE!<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that GOTTA VOTE! failed to include a disclaimer on a mailer prior to the 2012 presidential election that expressly advocated the election of President Obama and the Democratic Party in violation of the Act and Commission regulations.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the matter in light of the limited information available to determine whether the mailer qualified as a public communication under the Act and the unlikelihood that further investigation would determine the person or group responsible for the mailer.</p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6674</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: Preston Elliott on behalf of Montanans for Tester<br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: Montanans for Rehberg and Lorna Kuney, in her official capacity as treasurer; Dennis Rehberg; Ted P. Beck; and Vicki E. Beck<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Rehberg; and Montanans for Rehberg and Kuney, in her official capacity as treasurer (the Committee) accepted excessive in-kind contributions when the Becks permitted their bus to be used in connection with campaign events and covered related expenses in violation of the Act and Commission regulations. Rehberg was a 2012 candidate for United States Senate from the state of Montana.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the allegation that the Committee accepted and the Becks made excessive in-kind contributions in light of the difficulty in determining the market value of renting a bus similar to the one owned by the Becks, the lack of detail in how the parties arrived at their valuations for the bus and in consideration of Commission priorities. The Commission found no reason to believe Rehberg violated the Act or Commission regulations as it does not appear that he was personally involved in the transaction at issue.</p>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6734</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANTS: Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Melanie Sloan; Campaign Legal Center and Paul S.

Scott Frantz; John Cooney; Elizabeth Wiskemann; Edward Donaghy; Michael Keiser; John Roeser; Josephine Freede; Don Scifres; Timothy Travis; William Smithburg; and Alan Sieroty<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that 32 individuals had exceeded the $42,600 aggregate biennial limit for contributions to candidate committees during the 2012 election cycle.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission dismissed the matter in light of the fact that on April 2, 2014, in <em>FEC v. McCutcheon, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the aggregate biennial contribution limits do not further the government&#8217;s interest in preventing actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo </em>corruption.</p>\n          <p><strong/></p>\n          <p><strong>AUDITS</strong></p>\n          <p><strong/></p>\n          <p><a href=\"../../../audits/2012/AuditReport_2012_BuddyRoemerforPresident.shtml\">Final Audit Report on Buddy Roemer for President, Inc.
