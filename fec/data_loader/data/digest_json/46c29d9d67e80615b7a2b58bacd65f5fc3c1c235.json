Blayne Honeycutt; and Valerie Honeycutt <br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: Kevin P. LeMaire<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Calvin C. Fayard, Jr. or Cynthia Fayard provided the funds their daughter Chalyn Fayard used to make a $10,000 contribution to the federal account of the Democratic State Central Committee of Louisiana. The complaint alleged further that the $55,000 in additional contributions to that federal account, which the committee reported had been made by Fayard family members, were in fact contributions from an unnamed source.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe the respondents violated the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) or Commission regulations in light of available information that shows Chalyn Fayard made the $10,000 contribution with her own funds, and because respondents denied the speculative allegations regarding the additional $55,000 in contributions. &#160;</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public one campaign finance enforcement matter that was resolved through its Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) program. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">ADR 612 </a>&#8211; Friends of Sean Bielat and Norm Fay, in his official capacity as treasurer.
