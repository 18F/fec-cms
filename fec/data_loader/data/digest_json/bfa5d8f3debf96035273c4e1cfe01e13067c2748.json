Nicholas Ruiz III was a 2012 primary candidate for Florida&#8217;s 24th Congressional District and then its 7th Congressional District, and a 2014 primary candidate in Florida&#8217;s 9th Congressional District.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe the payments constituted personal use under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), because it appears that Danielle Ruiz provided bona fide services to the campaign and that the payments at issue did not exceed the fair market value of her services.</p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6361<br/>\n          </a>COMPLAINANT: Dena Stebbins DeCamp<br/>\n  RESPONDENTS: Tea Party and Frederic B. O&#8217;Neal, in his official capacity as treasurer (a terminated federal committee) (Tea Party [Federal]); and Tea Party (a minor political party/party executive committee) (Tea Party [Florida])<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that the Tea Party [Florida] lacked a federal committee or account and that two outdoor billboards it funded constituted impermissible contributions to federal candidates because those billboards apparently were financed with state and corporate funds.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe the Tea Party [Federal] and O&#8217;Neal, in his official capacity as treasurer, violated the Act or Commission regulations because that entity did not engage in any of the activities of the Tea Party [Florida], a separate judicial entity, at issue in this matter. The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the allegations that the Tea Party [Florida] (1) impermissibly used non-federal funds to conduct federal election activity, (2) failed to register and report with the Commission as a political committee, and (3) failed to report the cost of a billboard and certain other printed materials containing express advocacy and failed to include appropriate disclaimers in those materials, in light of the fact that the Tea Party [Florida] engaged in relatively limited activity and in light of the relatively low amount in violation. <br/>\n          </p>\n          <p><strong><br/>\n          ADMINISTRATIVE FINES </strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>\n          <p>The Commission made public six campaign finance enforcement matters that were resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program, as follows.
