FEC</a></em>. On February 2, plaintiffs filed a <a href=\"../../law/litigation/rnc_rnc_supp_mem_cu.pdf\">Supplemental Memorandum Regarding <em>Citizens United v. FEC</em></a> in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The RNC complaint challenges the constitutionality of the <a href=\"../../pages/bcra/bcra_update.shtml\">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act&#8217;s</a> limits on the use of nonfederal funds by political party committees. The Plaintiffs state that the nonfederal fund provisions as applied to their intended activities are overly broad and unconstitutional under the First Amendment guarantees of free speech and association, and are outside of Congress&#8217; authority to regulate elections. The Commission contends that those provisions are constitutional contribution limits that prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"../../law/litigation/schonberg.shtml\"><em>Schonberg v. FEC</em></a>.&#160; On February 2, the Commission filed a <a href=\"../../law/litigation/schonberg_fec_mot_dismiss.pdf\">Motion to Dismiss</a> in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Ocala Division. In this case, plaintiffs have filed a complaint against the FEC and certain Members of Congress and also requested an emergency injunction and an emergency three-judge court. The plaintiffs alleged that portions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), that permit Members of Congress to lead campaign committees are unconstitutional because they violate the Emoluments Clause, which states that Members can't hold other federal offices while in Congress. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida denied the plaintiffs' requests for emergency relief. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>AUDIT REPORTS</strong></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"../../audits/2008/20100201MGravelforpres.pdf\">Mike Gravel for President 2008</a>.
