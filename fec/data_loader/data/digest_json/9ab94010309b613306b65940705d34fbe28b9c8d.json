Robinson; Art Robinson for Congress and Noah Robinson, in his official capacity as treasurer; Althouse Press; Access to Energy; Oregon Institute for Science and Medicine; and Robinson Curriculum<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that (1) Art Robinson for Congress and Noah Robinson, in his official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) received $70,550 in excessive contributions, (2) Robinson&#8217;s businesses made, and the Committee received, corporate contributions and the Committee failed to properly disclose support from his businesses as in-kind contributions, and (3) Robinson&#8217;s businesses may have served as conduits for earmarked contributions but neither the businesses nor the Committee filed conduit reports. The complaint alleged further that the Committee failed to disclose contributor information and did not make best efforts to do so, and Robinson and his businesses violated the disclaimer provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act).&#160; Robinson was a 2010 candidate in Oregon&#8217;s 4th Congressional District. <br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe the Committee knowingly accepted excessive contributions, because the Committee was entitled to receive a separate contribution limit for each of two primary elections. The Commission also found no reason to believe that Althouse Press, the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine or the Robinson Curriculum made and the Committee knowingly accepted corporate contributions because there is no record evidence to support the allegations, which appear to be speculative. The Commission also found no reason to believe that the Committee, Althouse Press or Access to Energy failed to disclose earmarked contributions made through a conduit, because Robinson is the only employee of the two companies and Commission regulations exclude the candidate from the definition of a conduit or intermediary. The Commission dismissed the allegations that the Committee failed to disclose contributor employer and occupation information, in light of the Committee&#8217;s improved disclosures later in the election cycle and in furtherance of the Commission&#8217;s priorities relative to other matters. The Commission also dismissed the allegation that the Committee accepted excessive contributions from four contributors, in view of the limited number and amount of excessive contributions at issue and the Committee&#8217;s corrective actions. Finally the Commission dismissed the allegations that the Committee, Robinson, Althouse Press and the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine failed to include disclaimers because the communications at issue contained sufficient identifying information to prevent the public from being misled as to who authorized and paid for the solicitation. The Commission sent a letter reminding the Committee of the requirements on disclosing contributor employer and occupation information, as well as the requirements for disclaimers.</p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FINES</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public one campaign finance enforcement matter that was resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">AF 2122</a> &#8211; Robinson Committee, LLC and Jack E.
