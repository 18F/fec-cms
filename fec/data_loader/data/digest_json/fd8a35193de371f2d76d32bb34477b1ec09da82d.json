The Commission must issue a response no later than 20 days after receipt of the complete request, that is, by October 11, 2012, because this request was submitted by a Federal candidate within 60 days before a Federal election. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1224773.pdf\"><strong>AOR 2012-33 (Pennsylvania Democratic Party)</strong></a>.
