The requestors, the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, ask whether, in light of recent legislation removing the national party committees' entitlement to public financing for presidential nominating conventions, each may raise federal funds under a separate contribution limit for its separate convention committee or for deposit in a segregated account of the national party committee to finance the 2016 presidential nominating conventions.

McCrosson, Jr. <br/>\n          SUBJECT: In the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities and based on information contained in a complaint, the Commission initiated proceedings to determine whether there was reason to believe that McCrosson (1) converted contributions to a federal candidate for personal use; (2) filed false reports with the Commission; and (3) failed to accurately keep an account of and disclose disbursements and cash-on-hand balances.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission found reason to believe McCrosson knowingly and willfully violated the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act). The Commission agreed to accept a conciliation agreement that does not provide for payment of a civil penalty due to McCrosson&#8217;s demonstration of financial hardship but (1) does contain admissions of violations and (2) prohibits him from working or volunteering for federal political committees in a capacity involving the committee&#8217;s fundraising or finances for 10 years.</p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6750</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: Guillermo Cabrera<br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: Carl DeMaio for Congress and Paul Kilgore, in his official capacity as treasurer; Reform San Diego with Carl DeMaio f.k.a. Reform San Diego; and Carl DeMaio<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Reform San Diego with Carl DeMaio f.k.a. Reform San Diego (RSD), a city-registered committee founded by DeMaio to support local ballot measures, solicited, received or directed funds outside the federal source restrictions and used those funds to make excessive, in-kind contributions for DeMaio&#8217;s exploration of a federal candidacy. DeMaio is a 2014 candidate for California&#8217;s 52nd Congressional District.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe that funds spent by RSD were to test the waters of a federal candidacy by DeMaio based on the available information indicating that the expenditures in question were all for the purpose of promoting RSD&#8217;s ballot measure activity. </p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FINES</strong><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </strong></p>\n          <p>The Commission made public nine campaign finance enforcement matters that were resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program, as follows.
