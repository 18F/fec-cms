For more information, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.<br/>\n              <br/>\n              <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6405</a><br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee<br/>\n  RESPONDENTS: Friends of John McCain Inc. and Keith A. Davis, in his official capacity as treasurer; John McCain; Ruth McClung for Congress and Anne Loftfield, in her official capacity as treasurer; Ruth McClung; Kelly for Congress and Kristen L. Smith, in her official capacity as treasurer; and Jesse Kelly<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that McCain and Friends of John McCain Inc. and Davis, in his official capacity as treasurer (McCain Committee) made and McClung, Ruth McClung for Congress and Loftfield, in her official capacity as treasurer (McClung Committee) and Kelly, Kelly for Congress and Smith, in her official capacity as treasurer (Kelly Committee), received excessive, in-kind contributions as a result of coordinated communications. The complaint alleged further that the McCain Committee jeopardized its authorized committee status by providing support to other federal candidates by paying for independent communications that expressly advocated those candidates&#8217; election. McClung and Kelly were 2010 candidates in Arizona&#8217;s 7th and 8th Congressional Districts, respectively. McCain was a 2010 candidate for Arizona&#8217;s United States Senate seat.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe coordination occurred because the advertisements at issue did not appear to satisfy the conduct prong of the Commission&#8217;s coordination regulations. The Commission further exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the allegation that McCain and the McCain Committee violated 52 U.S.C. &#167; 30102(e)(3)(A) (formerly 2 U.S.C. &#167; 432(e)(3)(A)), because it is unlikely that independent spending by authorized committees would be deemed more potentially corrupting than independent expenditures by individuals, political parties, or corporations.</p>\n          <p/>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6712</a><br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: Revolvis Consulting, Inc. <br/>\n  RESPONDENT: Kreegel for Congress and Alan Childers, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Kreegel for Congress and Childers, in his official capacity as treasurer (the Committee), failed to report a debt of $49,762.63 for consulting services that Revolvis rendered to the Committee.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the matter in light of the remedial action taken by the Committee in amending its reports shortly after being notified of the complaint.</p>\n          <p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FINES</strong></p>\n          <p>The Commission made public four campaign finance enforcement matters that were resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program, as follows.
