On April 18, the Commission made public a&#160;<a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1239356.pdf\">supplement to the request including comments</a>&#160;on the draft advisory opinions. The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is seeking a renewal of a partial exemption the Commission has granted in the past from certain reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) and Commission regulations. The exemption has allowed the SWP to avoid disclosure of the identities of contributors to the SWP and the identities of recipients of SWP disbursements. The SWP files reports with the Commission containing coded references for itemized contributors and recipients of disbursements, rather than names, addresses and other identifying information.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1239014.pdf\">AOR 2013-02 (Winslow)</a>.
