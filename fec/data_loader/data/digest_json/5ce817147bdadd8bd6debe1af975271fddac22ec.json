Mullin is a candidate for Congress from Oklahoma, and also the President and CEO of Mullin Plumbing, Inc. and Mullin Plumbing West Division, Inc. (the companies). Mullin asked whether the companies' proposed radio and television advertisements, in which he appears, are electioneering communications if aired in a pre-election time period. Mullin also asked whether, when he files disclosure reports for the companies' electioneering communications, he would be required to disclose the names and addresses of customers who paid $1,000 or more for the companies' services.
