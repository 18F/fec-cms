Federal Election Commission</em></a>. On April 2, plaintiffs filed a <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/rnc_notice_appeal_sc.pdf\">notice of appeal</a> to the United States Supreme Court following the <a href=\"../../law/litigation/rnc_opinion_3judge.pdf\">opinion</a> of a three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n        <p><br/>\n            <u><a href=\"../../law/litigation/beam.shtml\">Beam v. FEC </a></u>(formerly Beam v. Gonzales). On March 29, the Commission filed its second <a href=\"../../law/litigation/beam_fec_mem_sj_2d.pdf\">Motion for Summary Judgment</a> in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois after that court denied the first motion. The Commission has argued that the court should enter judgment for the Commission because the plaintiffs have failed to uncover evidence of a violation of the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the sole claim remaining in the case. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"../../law/litigation/schonberg.shtml\">Schonberg v. FEC</a>. On March 29, the Commission filed its second <a href=\"../../law/litigation/schonberg_fec_mot_dismiss.pdf\">Motion to Dismiss</a> in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Ocala Division. In this case, plaintiffs filed a complaint against the FEC and certain Members of Congress and also requested an emergency injunction and an emergency three-judge court. The plaintiffs alleged that portions of the Federal Election Campaign Act that permit Members of Congress to lead campaign committees are unconstitutional because they violate the Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution, which states that Members of Congress cannot hold other federal offices while in Congress. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida denied the plaintiffs' requests for emergency relief. On March 29, the court granted the request of one of the two plaintiffs to dismiss her as a plaintiff in this case.<br/>\n        </p>\n        <p><strong>RULEMAKING AND AGENCY PROCEDURES</strong></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>On April 2, the Commission posted the <a href=\"../../pdf/nprm/solicitationshays3/candidate_solicitation_hearing_transcript.pdf\">transcript</a> from the March 16 <u>hearing</u> on the <a href=\"../../pdf/nprm/solicitationshays3/notice_2009-26.pdf\">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Participation by Federal Candidates and Officeholders at Non-Federal Fundraising Events</a>.<br/>\n        </p>\n        <p>On March 29, the Commission posted a <a href=\"../../pdf/nprm/debtcollection/irs.pdf\">comment</a> received concerning the <a href=\"../../pdf/nprm/debtcollection/notice_2010-04.pdf\">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Collection of Administrative Debts and Collection of Debts Arising from Enforcement and Administration of Campaign Finance Laws</a>. </p>\n        <p><strong>CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS </strong></p>\n        <p>April 1:&#160; Texas Pre-Runoff reports were due.
