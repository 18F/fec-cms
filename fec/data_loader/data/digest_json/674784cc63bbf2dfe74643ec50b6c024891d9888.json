On February 25, 2013, the Commission determined to take no further action in the matter because (1) the statute of limitations had expired in connection with apparent reporting violations on the 2006 disclosure reports, (2) it appears that the Committee permanently ceased activity following the 2006 election, and had less than $40 cash-on-hand as of December 31, 2006 and a zero balance as of August 23, 2007, and (3) there was no information showing that Matthews had exceeded the $5,000 threshold that would have required her to file a Statement of Candidacy and designate an authorized committee for her 2008 campaign.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6705</a></p>\n        <p>COMPLAINANT: FEC-Initiated<br/>\n  RESPONDENT: Freedom and Prosperity PAC f/k/a John Dennis for Congress and Kelly Lawler, in her official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n  SUBJECT: In the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities, the Commission found that Freedom and Prosperity PAC f/k/a John Dennis for Congress and Lawler, in her official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) failed to report accurately its disbursements.&#160;<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission entered into a conciliation agreement providing for the Committee to pay a civil penalty of $5,500.<br/>\n        </p>\n        <p><strong>LITIGATION</strong><br/>\n            <br/>\n            <a href=\"../../law/litigation/fec_craig.shtml\"><em>FEC v.
