Calloway, in his official capacity as treasurer.<br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: Cynthia Green<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that the Committee to Elect Shirley Gibson for Congress (the Committee) and Calloway, in his official capacity as treasurer, (1) failed to include a disclaimer on a fundraiser invitation and (2) included several corporate logos on the invitation, suggesting corporate endorsement or sponsorship of the campaign. Gibson was a 2010 candidate for Florida&#8217;s 17th Congressional District.<br/>\n  OUTCOME: The Commission dismissed the matter because (1) the invitation apparently included appropriate disclaimer information and (2) Calloway, in his official capacity as treasurer, filed a sworn affidavit denying that the Committee had sought corporate endorsements and contributions. The Commission sent a letter reminding the Committee to Elect Shirley Gibson for Congress and Calloway, in his official capacity as treasurer, of the prohibition on acceptance of in-kind corporation contributions.</p>\n        <p><strong><span class=\"style2\"><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6337</a></span><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\" class=\"style2\"><br/>\n        </a></strong>RESPONDENTS: Jay Riemersma for Congress Campaign Committee and John Faber, in his official capacity as treasurer; Republican Member Senate Fund and Scott B. MacKenzie, in his official capacity as treasurer; John Patrick Yob and Strategic National Campaign Management LLC; and Charles Yob. COMPLAINANT: James R. Barry<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that (1) the Republican Member Senate Fund (the Fund) coordinated with the Jay Riemersma for Congress Campaign Committee and Faber, in his official capacity as treasurer (the Committee), in spending on radio ads promoting Riemersma&#8217;s candidacy through a common vendor, John Yob and his father Charles Yob, and (2) the Committee thus received excessive contributions. The complaint alleged further that the Committee accepted anonymous cash contributions in excess of $50. Riemersma was a 2010 primary candidate for Michigan&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District.<br/>\n  OUTCOME: The Commission found no reason to believe the respondents violated the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, because (1) the complaint contained no specific information indicating that any of the conduct standards of the coordinated communications rules were satisfied in this matter, and (2) no information was provided that contradicts the Committee&#8217;s explanation that the anonymous contributions were in amounts of less than $50. </p>\n        <p><strong><u><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6349</a></u><br/>\n          </strong>RESPONDENTS: Brumberg for Congress and Dr. Barry Brumberg, in his official capacity as treasurer; and David Ryan Brumberg.<br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: David B. Bouek<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Brumberg for Congress (the Committee), David Ryan Brumberg and Dr. Barry Brumberg, in his official capacity as treasurer, received and failed to report in a timely manner excessive in-kind contributions in the form of office space that the Committee leased at a rate below the usual fair-market value. David Ryan Brumberg was a 2010 candidate in New York&#8217;s 14th Congressional District.<br/>\n  OUTCOME: The Commission found no reason to believe that the Committee failed to report its rental payments properly or paid less than the fair-market value in rent because there was no supporting information. <br/>\n  <span class=\"style2\"><br/>\n  <strong><u><span class=\"style2\"><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6348</a></span></u> </strong></span><strong><br/>\n          </strong>RESPONDENTS: David Schweikert for Congress and Joyce Schweikert, in her official capacity as treasurer.<br/>\n  A <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocsMUR/11044291033.pdf\">Statement of Reasons</a> was issued by Vice Chair Caroline C.
