FEC</em></a>.&#160; On December 3, plaintiffs filed a complaint against the FEC and certain Members of Congress and also requested an emergency injunction and an emergency three-judge court. The plaintiffs alleged that portions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act), that permit Members of Congress to lead campaign committees are unconstitutional because they violate the Emoluments Clause, which states that Members can't hold other federal offices while in Congress. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida denied the plaintiffs' requests for emergency relief. </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>On December 9, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion seeking recusal of the judge who had denied emergency relief and withdrawal of the Court's prior order. On the same day, the judge recused himself, directed the clerk to assign the case to a new judge, and stated that the motion to withdraw the prior order should be called to the attention of the newly assigned judge. On December 10, the clerk reassigned the case to a new judge. </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><strong>RULEMAKING AND AGENCY PROCEDURES</strong></p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>On December 7, the Commission published the <a href=\"../../law/cfr/ej_compilation/2009/notice_2009-27.pdf\">Final Rules on Campaign Travel</a> in the Federal Register. </p>\n              <p>On December 7, the Commission published the <a href=\"../../pdf/nprm/solicitationshays3/notice_2009-26.pdf\">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Federal Officeholders' and Candidates' Participation in Nonfederal Fundraising Events</a> in the Federal Register.
