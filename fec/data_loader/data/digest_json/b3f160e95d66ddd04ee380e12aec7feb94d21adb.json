Novacek</a></em>. The Commission alleges in this enforcement action that defendant Novacek created several entities -- including the \"Republican Victory Committee\" -- and made misrepresentations to vendors and the general public stating or implying that the entities were raising money for a political party committee. The FEC found probable cause to believe that the fundraising solicitations by phone and in mailers constituted knowing and willful fraudulent misrepresentations of the source of the solicitation and raised more than $75,000. In addition, the defendants are alleged to have failed to include on their communications some of the required disclaimer information, such as the street address, telephone number, or Internet address of the person who paid for the communication.<br/>\n              </p>\n              <p><strong>CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS </strong></p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><a name=\"FEAShays3\"/>January 7 &#8211; Massachusetts Special Senate Pre-General Reports were due.
