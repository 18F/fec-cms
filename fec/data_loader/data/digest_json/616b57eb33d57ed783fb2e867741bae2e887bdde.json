Healy, Chairman<br/>\n  SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that (1) Cynthia Blumenthal made an excessive contribution to her husband&#8217;s campaign committee, Blumenthal for Senate (the Committee); (2) Richard and Cynthia Blumenthal made a contribution in the name of another; and (3) the Committee&#160; knowingly filed false disclosure reports with the Commission. Specifically, the complaint alleged that Blumenthal did not have the personal funds necessary to make the approximately $2.5 million in candidate loans reported by the Committee and Zamore, in her official capacity as treasurer, because the loan amount exceeded the amount of personal funds Blumenthal had disclosed previously in his Personal Financial Disclosure Report. Blumenthal was a 2010 candidate for Connecticut&#8217;s U.S. Senate seat.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe respondents violated the Act in light of information confirming Richard Blumenthal had sufficient personal funds to make the loans.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>For information regarding each of the above matters, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FINES</strong></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public one campaign finance enforcement matter that was resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program. </p>\n        <p>AF 2267 &#8211; Alaska Republican Party and Glenn W.
