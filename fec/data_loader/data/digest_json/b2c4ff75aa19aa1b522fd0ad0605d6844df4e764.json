On February 27, the Commission discussed and voted on two draft advisory opinions based on a request from Revolution Messaging, LLC, but was unable to render an opinion by the required four affirmative votes.

During the discussion, the Commission heard from counsel and the requestor. Vice Chair Ann M. Ravel and Commissioners Steven T. Walther and Ellen L.

On February 27, the Commission held over discussion of a <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/201401.pdf\">draft advisory opinion</a> based on a request from the Solano County Democratic Central Committee.

For more information, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.</p>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6567</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: John K. Motsinger, Sr. <br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: Bruce Peller; and Bruce Peller for Congress and Paula Andrea Henao, in her official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Bruce Peller for Congress and Henao, in her official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) did not file a statement of organization, a statement of candidacy or a quarterly report. The complaint alleged further that the Committee did not include a proper disclaimer on its yard signs.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the matter in light of the fact that the Committee appears to have been misled by its former treasurer and took prompt remedial action, and in light of Commission resources. </p>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6720</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: Ronald Winter<br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: Christopher C. Healy; Jerry Labriola, Jr.; and Connecticut Republican State Central Committee and Gary Schaffrick, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that the Connecticut Republican State Central Committee and Schaffrick, in his official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) and its leaders, chairman and former treasurer Labriola and former&#160; chairman Healy, may have violated the Act by establishing an account&#160; under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Healy Fund) purportedly used to solicit and accept funds from state sources to pay federal campaign debts, including a payment owed to the complainant. The complainant also alleged that the Committee failed to pay him for work allegedly performed on behalf of the Committee for the congressional campaign of Joseph Visconti.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe the Committee and Labriola violated the Act&#8217;s prohibition on the use of non-federal funds to pay federal campaign debts because the available information suggested that (1) the Committee, not the Healy Fund, compensated the complainant and did so with federal funds, and (2) the Healy Fund, used to raise and spend non-federal money donations in connection with Healy's campaign to be re-elected chairman of the Committee, made no payments to the complainant. The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the allegation that Healy violated the prohibition on directing or soliciting donations to the Healy Fund in order to pay the Committee's debt to the complainant, in light of the low dollar amount at issue and an indication that the complainant was paid with federal funds. The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed an allegation concerning the proper reporting of a debt to the complainant in light of the fact that the Committee settled the debt and in light of the amount at issue. The Commission sent a letter reminding the Committee of the reporting requirements concerning disputed debt. </p>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6739</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: FEC-Initiated and Self-Initiated<br/>\n          RESPONDENTS: Washington State Republican Party and Tom Perry, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT: In the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities, and as a result of a sua sponte submission by the Washington State Republican Party, the Commission learned that the Washington State Republican Party and Perry, in his official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) misstated financial activity, including Levin Fund financial activity, and failed to accurately report receipts, disbursements, and cash-on-hand.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission entered into a conciliation agreement providing for the Committee to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.</p>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6756</a> <br/>\n          COMPLAINANT: FEC-Initiated<br/>\n          RESPONDENT: Winning Our Future and Brent A. Mudd, in his official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT: In the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities, the Commission initiated proceedings to determine whether there was reason to believe that Winning Our Future and Mudd, in his official capacity as treasurer, failed to disclose all disbursements or to file 24-hour reports disclosing $1,618,146.41 in a timely manner.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission closed the file.
