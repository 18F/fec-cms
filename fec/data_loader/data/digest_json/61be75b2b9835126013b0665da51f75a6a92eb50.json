FEC</a> </em>In this case, Citizens United challenges the application of BCRA's electioneering communication provisions to the cable-video-on demand broadcast of a film produced by Citizens United, as well as to televised advertising for that film. In July 2008, a three-judge district court found that BCRA was constitutional as applied to all of Citizens United's activity and granted summary judgment to the Commission. Citizens United appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral argument in the case on March 24, 2009.&#160; </p>\n              <p>On June 29, the Supreme Court issued an order directing the parties to submit supplemental briefs on whether two earlier Supreme Court decisions, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce and portions of McConnell v. FEC, which upheld limits on corporate and union campaign expenditures, should be overruled.&#160; The order also set the case for reargument on September 9, 2009.</p>\n              <p><a href=\"../../law/litigation/unity08.shtml\"><em>Unity08 v. FEC</em></a> On June 29, the Commission filed its <a href=\"../../law/litigation/unity_ac_fec_brief.pdf\">merits brief</a> in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In this action, Unity08 &#8211; a group that sought to nominate and elect a bipartisan ticket for President and Vice President in the 2008 elections &#8211; challenges a Commission advisory opinion that advised Unity08 that it would have to register as a political committee once it made more than $1,000 in expenditures. The district court granted summary judgment to the Commission, and Unity08 appealed.&#160; On appeal, Unity08 argues that the Commission's advisory opinion incorrectly interpreted FECA's definition of \"expenditure\" and incorrectly applied the Supreme Court's \"major purpose\" test. The Commission's brief argues that (a) the case is moot because Unity08 has ceased its operations, (b) advisory opinions are not subject to direct judicial review, and (c) the advisory opinion at issue was neither an unreasonable interpretation of FECA nor contrary to any other law.</p>\n              <p><em><a href=\"../../law/litigation/beverly.shtml\">Beverly v. FEC</a> </em>On July 1, the Commission received an order from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Arnold Dewalt Beverly alleged that the FEC had failed to assist him in announcing a write-in presidential campaign. The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed the dismissal of the case by the district court for the Eastern District of California. </p>\n              <p><strong>PRESS RELEASES</strong></p>\n              <p><a href=\"20090630MUR_5504.shtml\">FEC Settles Allegations of Impermissible Contributions</a> (released June 30, 2009)<br/>\n                  <br/>\n                  <strong>NEXT WEEK (JULY 6 &#8211; 10, 2009)</strong></p>\n              <p>No Commission Open Sessions or Executive Sessions are scheduled. </p>\n              <p><strong>UPCOMING REPORTING DUE DATES</strong></p>\n              <p>July 15 &#8211; July Quarterly Report</p>\n              <p>July 20 &#8211; July Monthly Report</p>\n              <p>July 31 &#8211; July Mid-Year Report</p>\n              <p><strong>UPCOMING EVENTS</strong></p>\n              <p>July 8 &#8211; The FEC will host <a href=\"../../info/outreach.shtml#roundtables\">workshops</a> on reporting requirements and its FECFile software to help candidates, parties and PACs prepare to file their July quarterly, monthly or mid-year reports. </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>July 14, 15, 16 &#8211; Commission Open/Executive Sessions.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>July 28-29, Columbus, OH &#8211; <a href=\"../../info/outreach.shtml#state\">State Outreach Program</a>.
