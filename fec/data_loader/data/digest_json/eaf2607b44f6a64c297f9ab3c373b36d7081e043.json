The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) asks whether it may make disbursements from its recount fund before the 2010 general election date to pay for recount-related expenses. The DSCC also asks whether it may allocate expenses that are attributable to both recount activities and campaign activities using certain allocation methods. The Commission must issue a response no later than 60 days after receipt of a complete request, that is, by September 7, 2010. </p>\n        <p><strong><br/>\n          Concurring Opinion Issued</strong><br/>\n        </p>\n        <p><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\"><strong>AO 2010-07 (Yes on FAIR)</strong></a>.

Bauerly and Commissioners Ellen L. Weintraub and Steven T. Walther. On June 14, the Commission approved AO 2010-07, concluding that Members of Congress may solicit unlimited donations on behalf of Yes on FAIR during the period before the initiative qualifies for the November 2010 general election ballot, and may solicit up to $20,000 from individuals after the initiative qualifies for the ballot. The Commission could not render an opinion as to whether Members of Congress may solicit funds outside the Act&#8217;s limitations and prohibitions after the initiative qualifies for the ballot. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>Advisory Opinions and Requests are available<a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=pending\"> here</a>. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>LITIGATION </strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><a href=\"../../law/litigation/beam.shtml\">Beam v.

On July 6, the Commission filed a Motion in Limine and Memorandum in Support of Its Motion in Limine in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
