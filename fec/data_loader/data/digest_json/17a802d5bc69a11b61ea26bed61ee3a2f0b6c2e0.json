On April 6, the Commission made public a <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1206037.pdf\">draft</a> of Advisory Opinion 2012-07. Feinstein for Senate (the Committee) was, until recently, a client of Durkee &amp; Associates, and Ms. Kinde Durkee served as the Committee&#8217;s Treasurer. After Durkee&#8217;s arrest in 2011, the Committee learned that it had a maximum of $662,100.87 in its accounts, which was considerably less than the Committee had expected and reported. The Committee asks the Commission whether \"the donors who attempted to contribute to the Committee, but whose funds were embezzled by Durkee, may make replacement contributions to the Committee without the attempted contributions counting against the donors' per election limits.\" Public comments on the draft are due by noon on April 11.<strong/></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">AO 2012-08 (Repledge)</a>.</strong> On April 5, the Commission made public a <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1205978.pdf\">draft</a> of Advisory Opinion 2012-08. Repledge proposes to establish a web-based platform that allows supporters of opposing federal candidates to redirect potential contributions to charitable organizations. Repledge asks a number of questions relating to its proposal, including whether it will (1) receive contributions, (2) have the major purpose of influencing a federal election, and (3) violate the prohibition on corporate contributions to candidates. Public comments on the draft are due by noon on April 11.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong><a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao\">AO 2012-10 (Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, Inc.)</a></strong>. On April 6, the Commission made public <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1206029.pdf\">three drafts</a> of Advisory Opinion 2012-10. The requestor, Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, Inc. (GQRR), is a political research and strategic consulting firm. GQRR plans to conduct telephone survey research of New Hampshire voters on behalf of certain federal candidates and nonprofit organizations. The survey research will refer only to candidates for federal office and not to any candidate for state or local office. GQRR asks whether certain provisions of the New Hampshire Revised Statutes, which require that certain disclaimers be made in the course of certain telephone surveys, are preempted by the Act.

Marcus, in her official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n  COMPLAINANT: Edward C. Maulbeck <br/>\n  SUBJECT:&#160; The complaint alleged that Loyola Enterprises, Inc., Benito Ben Loyola, Loyola for Congress and Marcus, in her official capacity as treasurer, made or accepted an in-kind corporate contribution through the use of corporate facilities in connection with a federal election. The complaint alleged further that the contribution, which involved a Loyola Enterprises, Inc. employee posting campaign signs, was not disclosed to the Commission. Benito Ben Loyola was a 2010 primary candidate for Virginia&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District.<br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe Loyola Enterprises, Inc., Benito Ben Loyola, Loyola for Congress and Marcus, in her official capacity as treasurer, violated the Act or Commission regulations because neither an employee&#8217;s occasional, isolated or incidental use of a corporation&#8217;s facilities for the employee&#8217;s own individual volunteer activity in connection with an election, nor the employee&#8217;s rental of a van from the corporation consistent with past practice, would constitute a prohibited in-kind contribution.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>LITIGATION</strong></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><em><a href=\"../../law/litigation/van_hollen.shtml\">Van Hollen v.
