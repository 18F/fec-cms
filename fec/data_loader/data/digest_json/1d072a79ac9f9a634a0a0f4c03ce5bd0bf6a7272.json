The Commission concluded that the Bill White for Texas Committee may accept contributions for a special or runoff election that has not been scheduled or may not occur, if those contributions are alternatively designated for a primary or general election that will occur.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>On July 28, the Commission approved Advisory Opinion 2009-16 (Libertarian Party of Ohio). The Commission concluded that the Libertarian Party of Ohio (the LPO) qualifies as a state party committee.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>On July 28, the Commission approved Advisory Opinion 2009-18 (Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P., Penske Truck Leasing Corp. and Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. PAC). The Commission concluded that Penske PAC and General Electric Company PAC (GEPAC) are no longer affiliated for purposes of the Act.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>Advisory Opinion Considered</p>\n              <p>On July 28, the Commission was unable to reach an opinion on Advisory Opinion Request 2009-17 (Romney for President, Inc.). The Committee asked whether, as it winds down to terminate, it can donate to a qualified charitable organization funds equivalent to the amount of un-cashed and stale-dated refund checks it issued to people who made excessive contributions to Gov. Mitt Romney&#8217;s 2008 presidential primary campaign.</p>\n              <p>On July 28, the Commission asked the Office of the General Counsel to circulate an amended draft on Advisory Opinion Request 2009-13 (Black Rock Group). The Black Rock Group, a communications and public affairs firm, seeks to serve as a vendor advising one or more single-member limited liability companies that make independent expenditures concerning federal candidates and elections. Black Rock Group asks whether its services would trigger political committee status for its clients. </p>\n              <p><strong><u>Extension of Time Received</u></strong> </p>\n              <p>On July 28, the Commission received an Extension of Time regarding Advisory Opinion 2009-14 (Mercedes-Benz USA LLC and Sterling Truck Corporation). The new deadline is August 31. MBUSA and Sterling ask whether MBUSA can establish and fund the administrative and solicitation costs of a separate segregated fund (SSF) for which Sterling would serve as the connected organization. MBUSA and Sterling are affiliated organizations with a common parent: Daimler North America Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the German corporation Daimler AG. The request also addresses the conventions that govern naming an SSF. MBUSA and Sterling have specifically asked whether the proposed SSF could be called DaimlerPAC. The Commission has reopened the period for comments on the drafts of this advisory opinion.&#160; The new deadline for comments is noon on Thursday, August 20, 2009.</p>\n              <p>Advisory Opinions, Requests, Comments and Extensions are available <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=ao&amp;AO=2932&amp;START=1064308.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>\n              <p>The Commission made public four closed cases and one Statement of Reasons this week.

Holder</em>, and affirmed that the Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act) does not require the Attorney General to get the FEC&#8217;s permission to investigate or prosecute a criminal violation of the Act. The plaintiff had asserted that no criminal investigation can take place unless the Commission has formally referred a criminal matter to the Attorney General, and that the Attorney General&#8217;s investigations are unlawful and unconstitutional if they did not result from an FEC referral to the Attorney General.</p>\n              <p><strong>CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS </strong></p>\n              <p>July 31: &#160;Mid-Year disclosure reports were due.&#160; Click <a href=\"../../elecfil/electron.shtml\">here</a> for information on electronic filing. </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><strong>OUTREACH</strong></p>\n              <p>On July 28-29, in Columbus, Ohio, the FEC conducted informal briefings for PACs, party committees and candidate committees on areas of the law specific to their needs.&#160; The event was part of the Federal Election Commissions <a href=\"../../info/outreach.shtml#state\">State Outreach Program</a>.&#160; </p>\n              <p/>\n              <p>On July 29, in Austin, Texas, Senior Communications Specialist Liz Kurland spoke about campaign finance rules for trade association PACs at the American Bankers Association conference.</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><strong>PRESS RELEASES</strong></p>\n              <p><a href=\"20090729_InternetImprvmt.shtml\">FEC Public Hearing on Website and Internet Communications Improvement Initiative</a> (released July 27)</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><a href=\"20090729_AO.shtml\">FEC Issues Three Advisory Opinions</a> (released July 29)</p>\n              <p/>\n              <p><a href=\"20090730websitehearing2.shtml\">FEC Holds Public Hearing on Improving Its Website and Internet Communications</a> (released July 30)</p>\n              <p>&#160;</p>\n              <p><strong>NEXT WEEK (AUGUST 3 &#8211; 7, 2009)</strong></p>\n              <p>No Commission Open Sessions or Executive Sessions are scheduled. </p>\n              <p>August 5-6, Kansas City, MO &#8211; <a href=\"../../info/outreach.shtml#state\">State Outreach Program</a>.
