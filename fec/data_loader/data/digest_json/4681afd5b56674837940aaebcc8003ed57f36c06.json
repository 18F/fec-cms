On March 11, the Commission adopted &#160;<u>Advisory Opinion 2010-02. </u>The Commission could not render an opinion on the first question posed in the advisory opinion request: whether the State party committee may use only the proceeds from the sale of its previous office building, which consist of non-Federal funds, to make payments on a lease that contains an option to purchase an office building. The second question posed in the advisory opinion request was whether the State party committee may use the proceeds from the sale of its previous office building to make payments on a land sales contract to purchase the building the contract. The Commission concluded that in principle, a State party committee may do so, subject to State law, but in the absence of a specific contract or more details the Commission could not determine whether the prospective land sales contract would qualify as a purchase of the office building under the Federal Election Campaign Act (the Act).&#160; Under the Act, State and local committees of political parties may, subject to State law, use exclusively non-Federal funds for the purchase or construction of an office building for the State or local committee.<u> </u>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n        <p>            <br/>\n            <u>Request Received</u><br/>\n            <br/>\n        <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/1099388.pdf\">AOR 2010-04 (Wawa, Inc.)</a>. On March 11, the Commission made public Advisory Opinion Request 2010-04 (Wawa, Inc.). The requester asks for clarification of which persons fall within the restricted class of persons who may be solicited at any time by a Separate Segregated Fund.&#160; The Commission must issue a response no later than 60 days after receipt of the complete request, that is, by May 9, 2010.</p>\n        <p>Advisory Opinions, Requests, Comments and Extensions are available <a href=\"http://saos.fec.gov/saos/searchao?SUBMIT=ao&amp;AO=2932&amp;START=1064308.pdf\">here</a>.<br/>\n            <strong><br/>\n  ENFORCEMENT</strong><br/>\n  <br/>\n  The Commission made public the following Statement of Reasons this week.

In 2007, the Commission dismissed the case against Schwarzenegger. In March 2009, the Commission voted 4-2 to dismiss the case using its prosecutorial discretion. A <u><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqsdocsMUR/10044262386.pdf\">Statement of Reasons</a></u> was issued by Chairman Matthew S. Petersen and Commissioners Caroline C. Hunter and Donald F. McGahn.* </p>\n        <p><strong>ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION </strong></p>\n        <p>The Commission made public two campaign finance enforcement matters that were resolved through its Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) program.

FEC</a></u></em>. Utility Workers filed a complaint with the Commission alleging that Covanta Energy Corporation solicited contributions for its federal PAC from employees outside its restricted class. The Commission found no reason to believe Covanta violated the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, and dismissed the matter.&#160; Utility Workers filed a complaint with the District Court of the District of Columbia pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 437g(a)(8) seeking judicial review of the Commission&#8217;s dismissal. On March 8, the United States District Court of the District of Columbia issued an <a href=\"../../law/litigation/uwu_opinion.pdf\">Opinion</a> and <a href=\"../../law/litigation/uwu_order.pdf\">Order</a> finding that the Commission had failed to adequately explain its reasoning in dismissing the matter.&#160; The court remanded the case back to the Commission for further proceedings. </p>\n        <p><strong>RULEMAKING AND AGENCY PROCEDURES</strong><br/>\n            <br/>\n  On March 11, the Commission voted to approve <a href=\"../../agenda/2010/mtgdoc1015.pdf\">Final Rules and an Explanation and Justification</a> to remove sections 106.6(c) 106.6(f), and 100.57 from the Commission&#8217;s regulations in accordance with the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <em><u><a href=\"../../law/litigation/emilyslist_08.shtml\">EMILY&#8217;S List v. Federal Election Commission</a></u></em>, 581 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2009). The vacated regulations concern funds received in response to solicitations and the allocation of expenses by separate segregated funds and nonconnected committees. The Commission plans to undertake a new rulemaking in the near future to consider additional conforming changes consistent with the court decision.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>The Commission also opened discussion on the possible adoption of an <a href=\"../../agenda/2010/mtgdoc1016.pdf\">interim enforcement policy</a> on the &#8220;Volunteer Materials&#8221; Exemption, as it relates to certain campaign mailings, that would provide guidance on how the Commission intends to enforce the exemption from the definition of &#8220;contribution&#8221; and &#8220;expenditure&#8221; located in sections 100.87 and 100.147 of the Commission&#8217;s rules, 11 CFR 100.87 and 11 CFR 100.147.&#160; Specifically, the interim enforcement policy would provide guidance regarding payments by State and local committees of a political party for the costs of certain campaign materials used by such committees in connection with volunteer activities on behalf of nominees of the party.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS</strong></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>March 8 &#8211; Texas Minor Party Pre-Conventions (Districts 1-6, 8-15, 17, 19, 21-28 and 31).
