Noem was a 2010 candidate for South Dakota&#8217;s 6th Congressional District.<br/>\n        DISPOSITION: The Commission closed the file.

PAC and Michael A. Duff, in his official capacity as treasurer; General Electric Company; General Electric Company PAC and Marie Talwar, in her official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n        COMPLAINANT:&#160; Peter J. Vroom<br/>\n        SUBJECT:&#160; The complaint alleged that Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. PAC and Duff, in his official capacity as treasurer, (Penske PAC) made 2010 primary and general election contributions to James Gerlach for Congress (the Committee) that exceeded the limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended (the Act) because Penske PAC and General Electric Company PAC and Talwar, in her official capacity as treasurer, (GEPAC) were affiliated and thus shared a single contribution limit. Gerlach was a 2010 candidate for Pennsylvania&#8217;s 6th Congressional District. The complaint challenged Advisory Opinion 2009-18, in which the Commission concluded that Penske PAC and GEPAC were disaffiliated, alleging that Penske PAC provided the Commission with &#8220;misleading and incomplete information.&#8221;<br/>\n        DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe Penske PAC and GEPAC exceeded contribution limits because, as the Commission determined in Advisory Opinion 2009-18, Penske PAC and GEPAC are properly disaffiliated and therefore the Penske PAC contributions at issue were not excessive. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>For information regarding the above matter, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.</p>\n        <p><strong>ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION </strong></p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>The Commission made public eight campaign finance enforcement matters that were resolved through its Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) program. </p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">ADR 570 </a>&#8211; Brady for Congress and Mike Karlins, in his official capacity as treasurer.
