Telthorst<br/>\n  SUBJECT: In the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities, the Commission initiated proceedings to determine whether Telthorst, the former treasurer of the Lynn Jenkins for Congress Committee (the Committee), knowingly and willfully violated the Act, when he mixed the Committee&#8217;s funds with his personal funds, failed to file accurate reports with the Commission and converted campaign funds to personal use. <br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission found reason to believe Telthorst knowingly and willfully violated the Act and agreed to accept a conciliation agreement that contains admissions of violations but does not provide for payment of a civil penalty due to Telthorst&#8217;s demonstration of financial hardship. <br/>\n&#160;<br/>\n  <strong>ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION <br/>\n&#160;<br/>\n  </strong>The Commission made public one campaign finance enforcement matter that was resolved through its Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) program, as follows.
