The complaint alleged further that Little Compton failed to report the costs of that portion of the mailer. Finally, the complaint alleged that Loughlin, and Friends of John Loughlin and Johnson, in her official capacity as treasurer, failed to report receipt of Little Compton&#8217;s purported in-kind contribution. Loughlin was a 2010 candidate for Rhode Island&#8217;s 1st Congressional District. <br/>\n  DISPOSITION: The Commission dismissed the matter in connection with Little Compton in light of the fact that the potential costs at issue were relatively low, given the small federal portion of the mailer, and in furtherance of the Commission&#8217;s priorities relative to other matters. The Commission found no reason to believe Loughlin, and Friends of John Loughlin and Johnson, in her official capacity as treasurer, violated the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, (the Act) or Commission regulations.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p>For information regarding the above matter, see the case documents in the <a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">Enforcement Query System</a>.</p>\n        <p/>\n        <p><strong>LITIGATION</strong></p>\n        <p><strong/></p>\n        <p><em><a href=\"../../law/litigation/crew110951_complaint.pdf\">CREW v.
