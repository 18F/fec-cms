(Wisconsin Jobs Now) made and Wall for Congress and Magnuson, in her official capacity as treasurer, (Wall Committee) and Wall accepted prohibited contributions in the form of Zellner&#8217;s campaign management services. The complaint also raised questions about potential coordination of protests between Wisconsin Jobs Now and the Wall Committee.<br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission found no reason to believe prohibited contributions occurred in light of the sworn statements denying, and information contradicting, the allegation that Zellner was simultaneously employed by Wisconsin Jobs Now and the Wall Committee. The Commission also found no reason to believe that Wisconsin Jobs Now made and the Wall Committee accepted a prohibited contribution in the form of coordination in light of the lack of information suggesting that Wisconsin Jobs Now had made an expenditure in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of Wall or the Wall Committee.</p>\n          <p><a href=\"http://eqs.fec.gov/eqs/searcheqs\">MUR 6675</a><br/>\n            COMPLAINANT: Kyrsten Sinema for Congress<br/>\n          RESPONDENT: Vernon Parker for Congress and Kelly Lawler, in her official capacity as treasurer<br/>\n          SUBJECT: The complaint alleged that Vernon Parker for Congress and Lawler, in her official capacity as treasurer, (the Committee) failed to include an appropriate disclaimer in automated phone calls the Committee funded.&#160; <br/>\n          DISPOSITION: The Commission exercised its prosecutorial discretion and dismissed the matter in light of the small scope of activity at issue and in consideration of Commission priorities. </p>\n          <p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE FINES</strong></p>\n          <p>The Commission made public one campaign finance enforcement matter that was resolved through its Administrative Fines (AF) program, as follows.
